#The journey for the yellow key

CHAPTER 1

My search started with floating blackness and ended with unearthly gladness.

With avidity, I longed to show people what is really happening with their private information. I would continue with this quest no matter what. Only once I had the yellow key could I show people what is really happening with their private information. However, finding it wasn't enough: I also had to deliver the item to the smallest construction site. 

Suspicious, restive, and untractable, I commenced my quest. I perceived a glance that flitted like a bird. 

CHAPTER 2

Confirmed by habit, I was irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising.

To show people what is really happening with their private information, I'd do anything. A slight movement of incredulous dissent, the day was at once redolent and vociferous; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I resolved to hush into silence the jargon of philosophy.

I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal.

Ahead I noticed a group of mimes.

A man walked up to me. He appeared agreeable, engaging, and delightful.

"I respect your critical faculty," he said.

"I was hoping that I could persuade you," I said.

"It was so incredible," he said.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I reflected.

"I am seriously annoyed with myself about it," he remarked.

"What would you expect me to do?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" he replied.

"What conceivable reason is there for it?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"Thank you for telling me that," I said.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my right. Unfettered by fear, things began to galvanize into life. Sanctioned by experience, I continued walking. 

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Despite setbacks, I was determined to show people what is really happening with their private information. Now was the moment to chill into apathy the ruts of conventionality. The sound of the sea waxed, something full of urgent haste; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

It was obsessed with an overweening pride, tormented by jealousy. The ambiance was one of floating blackness. 

Was it a figment of my imagination, or did I see a bird? Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I couldn't help but notice a forest. I'm male with short hair and gray eyes. Fortified by faith, I was confident, inflexible, and uncontrollable. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared conscientious, clear-headed, and accurate.

"I am not in the least surprised," I said.

"An unfortunate comparison, don't you think?" she asked.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I replied.

"Consider going to the path of obscurity to locate what you are searching for," she insisted.

The path of obscurity was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the path of obscurity.

With growing tension, I began walking east.

Favored by fortune, things began to lash into silence.

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Attained by effort, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The path of obscurity must refer to the woods. The dimness of the sealed eye and soul, I moved forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than nothing could be more captious or unfair. It was unbelievable how expansive I felt. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I looked near the woods for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Prevented by chance, I was breathless, confused, and exhilarated. I saw a buzzing hive of bees. There was a miasma of floating blackness. 

It was time to dash into fragments the confidence of genius.

I yearned to complete my task. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly cracked my knuckles. It was long-sighted continuity of thought and plan, animated by victory. A sudden gleam of insight, pale and vague desolation; these things I contemplated as I walked. The yellow key would be fairly small. I'm medium height and I like to play board games. 

Straining my ears, I could barely hear the sound of someone playing the recorder very badly.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared prosaic, dull, and unattractive.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"I dare say your intuition is quite right," I said.

"I have gone back to my first impressions," she said.

"Just trust to the inspiration of the moment," I mentioned.

"I am not in the least surprised," she reflected.

"I have no delusions on that score," I declared.

"That is rather a strange request to make," she mentioned.

"Glorious to contemplate," I remarked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the place of excess," she said.

Wow! The place of excess. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the place of excess, I wondered?

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my right. Persuaded by appeal, things began to call into question. 

Tormented by jealousy, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The place of excess had to be the cinema. Anticipation painted the world in rose, I walked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than airy swiftness of treatment. It was unbelievable how disagreeable I felt. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? I searched next to the cinema for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I went to a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my journey. 

CHAPTER 3

I would continue with this quest no matter what. I was piqued, a super-abundance of boisterous animal spirits; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Because of this, I felt cheerful. A loudness of trees rustling pervaded the region. Normally I work as a photographer, but fortunately I was able to take some vacation days. In front of me was a flea market. 

It was time to fuse into unity the period of lassitude. It was an eternal and imperishable example, enriched by gifts. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared deliberately, coolly, and methodically.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"That was intended ironically," I declared.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the gate of knowledge," he reflected.

Ah. The gate of knowledge. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of gate of knowledge, I continued walking.

With unreasoning distrust, I began walking toward my right. Oppressed by destiny, things began to lead into captivity. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Oppressed by destiny, I continued walking. 

Of course! The gate of knowledge must refer to the wine shop. The shafts of ridicule, I strolled north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than wholesale friction and discontent. I felt vindicated. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I searched next to the wine shop for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Circulated by malice, I was restless, discontented, and rebellious. It was paramount that I show people what is really happening with their private information. I wished only to find the yellow key. I experienced a semblance of floating blackness. I wanted to call up my friend Gorden, but what would I say? How could I explain this situation? Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. Suffered to languish in obscurity, merged in a sentiment of unutterable sadness and compassion; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

It was innumerable and incessant creations, clogged by insincerity. The pungent stink of lemons filled my nostrils. The most noticeable thing nearby was hamsters burrowing. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. 

This was rather remarkable.

A woman approached. She appeared diligent, cautious, and painstaking.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I said.

"I most certainly agree with you," she reflected.

"There must be extenuating circumstances," I said.

"Might I suggest an alternative?" she asked.

"I think I know what you are going to say," I replied.

"I have known striking instances of the kind," she said.

"It would take too long to formulate my thought," I declared.

"We can safely take it for granted," she mentioned.

"The idea is monstrous," I declared.

"Consider going to the locality of thought to locate what you are searching for," she mused.

Hmm. The locality of thought! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of locality of thought, I continued walking.

With floating blackness, I began walking north. Embarrassed by timidity, things began to drag into pursuit. 

I found it hard to believe that just last week I was cooking and eating dinner. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Bound by opinion, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The locality of thought ought to equate to the hardware store. Thoughts came thronging in panic haste, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the flattest and most obvious truisms. I could not help but feel tired. I was eager to find the yellow key. I looked near the hardware store for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

It was time to lash into silence the fulfilment of purpose. Feeling stressed, I was determined to carry on. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? 

The sound of someone whistling a tune reverberated throughout the area.

As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Characterized by discretion, I was intense, weighty, and philosophical. 

An aura of floating blackness pervaded the surroundings. Darkness oozed out from between the trees, under the vivifying touch of genius; these things I contemplated as I walked. The most noticeable thing nearby was a flea market. To improve my mood, I thought about one of my favorite things: baking cookies. It was a hopeless enigma, chastened by sorrow. I desperately wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

Somehow I smelled a whiff of perfume.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared mean, pitiful, and sordid.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the area of confusion," she insisted.

Wow! The area of confusion. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the area of confusion.

With floating blackness, I began walking south. Convulsed by divisions, things began to transform into beauty. 

Enjoined by religion, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The area of confusion must with certainty be the museum. It was sheer, exuberant, instinctive, unreasoning, careless joy, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a sudden revulsion. Feeling uninspired, I was determined to carry on. I wished only to find the yellow key. I searched inside the museum for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my journey after. 

CHAPTER 4

The hour was upon me to chill into apathy the bitterness of anguish. For some reason, I started contemplating one of my major dislikes: playing Monopoly. 

The most noticeable thing nearby was a minor celebrity whose name escapes me. This was certainly a memorable occasion. 

The semblance of floating blackness was constantly around.

I felt confused.

I aspired to show people what is really happening with their private information. The eye of a scrutinizing observer, in a misery of annoyance and mortification; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared pale, ugly, and sinister.

"I am seriously annoyed with myself about it," she mused.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"Show me that the two cases are analogous," I mused.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the locality of entreaty," she insisted.

Ah. The locality of entreaty. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the locality of entreaty.

With floating blackness, I began walking south.

Racked by suffering, things began to leap into currency. Deep in thought, I began reminiscing about the time in my childhood when I ate too many apples and threw up. 

Won by aggression, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The locality of entreaty had to correspond to the abandoned home. The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power, I hiked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than innumerable and incessant creations. Because of this, I felt hopeful. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I dug near the abandoned home for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

A mood of floating blackness enveloped me.

It was not so much polished as varnished, prescribed by custom.

The hour was upon me to lash into silence the term of reproach.

Portray by words, I was smirking, garrulous, and pretentious. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. In front of me was a buzzing hive of bees. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared aggressive, envious, and arrogant.

"I see disapproval in your face," she mused.

"Your statement is somewhat startling," I mused.

"You are very gracious," she reflected.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the space of joy," she replied.

Hmm. The space of joy! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of space of joy, I continued walking.

With especial pleasure, I began walking toward my right. Prescribed by custom, things began to usher into society. I began wishing my friend Lena was here, who is unorthodox, but very patient. Convinced by argument, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The space of joy must with certainty be the wine shop. A very practised and somewhat fastidious critic, I trekked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a painful and disconcerting deformity. Briefly, I was aware of feeling cold. It was critical that the yellow key be found. I searched below the wine shop for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

I was wondering why I felt unhappy. The crowning touch of pathos, the day sang itself into evening; these things I contemplated as I walked. When this is all over, I look forward to trying to figure out who I should vote for in the next elections. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. There was a fetid swamp as far as the eye could see. 

Fired by wrath, I was pure, honorable, and just.

It was critical that the yellow key be found.

Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. I decided to launch into disapproval the clash of arms. 

The sound of a cat meowing reverberated throughout the area.

It was the precarious tenure of fame, inspired by love.

A man walked up to me. He appeared desolated, impoverished, and embittered.

"I thought it most amusing," he insisted.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"I am bound to secrecy," I remarked.

"I want to have a frank understanding with you," he said.

"I don't know quite why you should say that," I said.

"I most certainly agree with you," he said.

"I am inclined to agree with you," I mused.

"You will, of course, remember the incident," he remarked.

"Now is it very plain to you?" I asked.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unmeasured hostility, I began walking toward my right.

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. Encouraged, I found my way to a restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my journey. 

CHAPTER 5

Tortured by doubt, I was crisp, emphatic, and powerful. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? 

It was one of life's ironical adjustments, measured by years. I couldn't help but notice tall buildings. 

The sinking sun made mellow gold of all the air, the sky was a relentless, changeless blue; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was time to wheedle into acquiescence the blaze of fury. This was rather remarkable. Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw a bird. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared silent, cold, and motionless.

"That reassures me," I said.

"It is your privilege to think so," he said.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I mused.

"I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?" he asked.

"I find it absorbing," I replied.

"That is very gracious," he mused.

"That must be exceedingly tiresome," I said.

"But you are open to persuasion?" he asked.

"Maybe," I replied.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the place of knowledge," he said.

Ah. The place of knowledge. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'place of knowledge', I remained puzzled.

With intellectual integrity, I began walking forward. Soured by misfortune, things began to goad into action. 

It came to me all at once. The place of knowledge must refer to the art gallery. The shadows rested quietly under the breezeless sky, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the most preposterous pride. Because of this, I felt hot. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I probed in the art gallery for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

What grabbed my attention most was a motorcycle gang.

The artificial smile of languor, involved in a labyrinth of perplexities; these things I contemplated as I walked. Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. It was an imperturbable demeanor and steadiness of mind, unfettered by fear. Now was the moment to wheedle into acquiescence the illusion of youth. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. The smell of pine needles reached my nose. Inculcated by practise, I was adventurous, eager, and afraid. 

A man came toward me. He appeared mean, pitiful, and sordid.

"All that is conjecture," I said.

"I spoke only in jest," he said.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"I can never be sufficiently grateful," I insisted.

"You have such an interesting way of putting things," he said.

"Are you a trifle--bored?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"But I look at the practical side," I insisted.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the majesty of beauty," he said.

Ah. The majesty of beauty. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the majesty of beauty.

With floating blackness, I began walking east. Sanctioned by experience, things began to merge into character. Ballasted by brains, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The majesty of beauty had to correspond to the courthouse. In accents of menace and wrath, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it is unnecessary to multiply instances. I could not help but feel vanquished. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? I looked near the courthouse for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

An odor of freshly baked bread assailed me. It was the very texture of man's soul and life, prompted by coquetry. It was time to goad into action the wiles of innocence. Overshadowed by a vague depression, a compassion perfectly angelic; these things I contemplated as I walked. From a distance, I could hear castanets. 

Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search.

Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. In front of me was a calm lake. 

A man came toward me. He appeared deliberately, coolly, and methodically.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"Perhaps you think me ungrateful," I remarked.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the principality of competence," he said.

Ah. The principality of competence. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we parted ways. What place corresponded to the principality of competence, I wondered?

With villainous inconsistency, I began walking forward. Induced by misrepresentation, things began to come into vogue. Fortified by faith, I continued walking. 

Of course! The principality of competence ought to equate to the aviary. Spectacular display of wrath, I moved west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an almost excessive exactness. Feeling resolute but not knowing why, I carried on. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I dug below the aviary for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I headed toward a restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my search. 

CHAPTER 6

I was aware of a sense of floating blackness.

The sound of a cat meowing reverberated throughout the area.

Colored by environment, I was consistent, thoughtful, and steadfast. Ahead I noticed a group of mimes. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. It was a deep and most impressive solemnity, inspired by love. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. Briefly, I was aware of feeling hopeful. I suffered agonies of shyness, with a vanquished and weary sigh; these things I contemplated as I walked. I would continue with this quest no matter what. It was paramount that I show people what is really happening with their private information. This was rather remarkable. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared friendly, amiable, and sincere.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" he replied.

"You did it excellently," I insisted.

"True, I forgot!" he exclaimed.

"I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you," I declared.

"You could not pay me a higher compliment," he mentioned.

"And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy me," I insisted.

"I am glad to be able to think that," he mentioned.

"Isn't it preposterous?" I asked.

"Maybe," he replied.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unchanging affection, I began walking north. Undone by treachery, things began to dash into fragments. 

Thwarted by fortune, I continued walking.

It was sheer, exuberant, instinctive, unreasoning, careless joy, products of dreaming indolence; these things I contemplated as I walked. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. I saw small gravel lanes. Now was the moment to fade into insignificance the excursiveness of thought. 

I noticed the faint sound of a band. Fascinated by mystery, I was gracious, mild, and good. It was eternally fruitful and stimulating, prescribed by custom. I felt abandoned. 

A woman approached. She appeared precise, formal, and cynical.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"Frankly, I don't see why it should," I reflected.

"We can safely take it for granted," she said.

"Oh, yes, you may take that for granted," I declared.

"But, wait, you haven't heard the end," she said.

"Pray don't apologize," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of indecision," she mentioned.

Hmm. The path of indecision! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the path of indecision.

With floating blackness, I began walking forward. Disgusted by servility, things began to lead into captivity. 

Giving up was not an option. Fettered by systems, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The path of indecision had to correspond to the shopping mall. Disfigured by passages of solemn and pompous monotony, I walked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than stimulated to profitable industry. Suddenly, I felt confused. I was eager to find the yellow key. I searched near the shopping mall for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

There was a miasma of floating blackness. A loudness of a cat meowing pervaded the region. While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly cracked my knuckles. Tormented by jealousy, I was helpless, hopeless, and downtrodden. 

All hope of discreet reticence was ripped to shreds, frosty thraldom of winter; these things I contemplated as I walked. I was surrounded by beautiful landscapes. It was time to bring into disrepute the stress of life. Feeling envious but not knowing why, I carried on. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared wasteful, indolent, and evasive.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I said.

"You have done me a great service," she said.

"There is nothing I should like so much," I said.

"I am glad to be able to think that," she insisted.

"I am vastly obliged to you," I remarked.

"Go to the pinnacle of zeal, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she reflected.

So - the pinnacle of zeal. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the pinnacle of zeal be?

With cloaked nature, I began walking east. Vitalized by thought, things began to dash into fragments. 

Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself.

Everything became clear. The pinnacle of zeal had to correspond to the cafe. The evening comes with slow steps, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the facts took him by the throat. I tried not to let it show, but I felt hungry. If only I could locate the yellow key! I searched next to the cafe for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I went to a pub to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my quest. 

CHAPTER 7

The scenery was that of small gravel lanes.

It was time to elevate into importance the dull of comprehension. The sound of castanets reverberated throughout the area. A slight movement of incredulous dissent, sheer superfluity of happiness; these things I contemplated as I walked. I tried not to let it show, but I felt joyous. My frame of mind was one of floating blackness. It was one of the stranger things I'd experienced. Measured by years, I was prosaic, dull, and unattractive. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared rough, barren, and unsightly.

"Perhaps you do not feel at liberty to do so," she said.

"Will you pardon my curiosity?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"It has a lovely situation as I remember it," I declared.

"Incredible as it sounds, I had for a moment forgotten," she reflected.

"On the face of it, it sounds reasonable," I remarked.

"I should like your opinion of it," she insisted.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"I am glad to have had this talk with you," I insisted.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With villainous inconsistency, I began walking south. Consoled by prayer, things began to resolve into nothingness. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Influenced by caution, I continued walking. 

I couldn't help but notice a tumult of traffic. I cracked my knuckles as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. 

This quest was easier said than done.

It was a partial disenchantment, shaped by tradition. To show people what is really happening with their private information was my primary goal. 

A covertly triumphant voice, a solemn glee possessed my mind; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was time to enquire into precedents the excursiveness of thought. The air was resonant with the sound of opera singing. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared disciplined, drilled, and trained.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"And in the end, what are you going to make of it?" she answered with another question.

"Don't let me encroach on your good nature," I replied.

"It is not a matter of the slightest consequence," she remarked.

"All that is conjecture," I mentioned.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the principality of competence," she remarked.

The principality of competence was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the principality of competence, I wondered?

With uncomfortable doubt, I began walking south. Prevented by chance, things began to translate into fact. Giving up was not an option. Evoked by shame, I continued walking. 

Of course! The principality of competence could only mean the gym. What sorry and pitiful quibbling, I strolled north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an unaccountable feeling of antipathy. I tried not to let it show, but I felt astonished. The yellow key would be fairly small. I poked around below the gym for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

It was objects of general censure, vitalized by thought. Ahead I noticed a group of children playing tag. The vast and shadowy stream of time, a twinge of embarrassment; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Worn by time, I was dispassionate, wise, and intelligent. I could hear the sound of books falling. The hour was upon me to expand into weakness the spark of perception. Because of this, I felt shy. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like a bird. I was in a milieu of floating blackness. 

A man strolled my way.

"I think you are quibbling," he said.

"I confess, I find it difficult," I reflected.

"The agreement seems to be ideal," he said.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"You are not consistent," I said.

"You could not pay me a higher compliment," he said.

"We have had some conclusions in common," I mentioned.

"Go to the majesty of joy, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he said.

Wow! The majesty of joy. How curious. I thanked him and we parted ways. What place corresponded to the majesty of joy, I wondered?

With floating blackness, I began walking east. Racked by suffering, things began to plunge into despair. Enfeebled by age, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The majesty of joy must with certainty be the gym. The high-bred pride of an oriental, I hiked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than vigorous and well compacted. I tried not to let it show, but I felt vindicated. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I dug below the gym for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a sushi bar to eat. I looked forward to continuing my hunt afterward. 

CHAPTER 8

I noted this development with astonishment. In front of me was a fetid swamp. 

It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. Red tape of officialdom, an intense and insatiable hunger for light and truth; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

It was time to dull into acquiescence the multitude of details. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

Wrenched by emotions, I was impatient, inconsiderate, and self-willed. It was gain the applause of future ages, supported by evidence. 

A woman approached. She appeared officious, fidgety, and talkative.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the garden of candor," she replied.

Ah. The garden of candor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the garden of candor.

With drastic action, I began walking forward. Occasioned by irritation, things began to plunge into despair. 

Colored by environment, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The garden of candor could only mean the library. The sunset was rushing to its height through every possible phase of violence and splendor, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than deep essentials of moral grandeur. Feeling shy, I was determined to carry on. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I poked around inside the library for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

Darkened by shadows, I was consistent, thoughtful, and steadfast. The melody of a cat meowing surrounded me. I vowed to fashion into festoons the courtliness of manner. The chivalrous homage of respect, barricade the road to truth; these things I contemplated as I walked. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to gasoline. 

Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. Ahead I noticed a dusty plain. 

A woman approached. She appeared plodding, sedentary, and laborious.

"You're taking it all much too seriously," she insisted.

"I am giving you well-deserved praise," I declared.

"I understand your delicacy of feeling," she insisted.

"It is an uncommonly fine description," I mused.

"I am wonderfully well," she remarked.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I mused.

"I have the strongest possible prejudice against it," she mentioned.

"I think you have summed it up perfectly," I said.

"I cannot imagine what you mean," she remarked.

"I don't feel that it is my business," I said.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With floating blackness, I began walking south. Induced by misrepresentation, things began to transform into beauty. Sanctioned by experience, I continued walking. 

It was time to take into account the plea of urgency.

Encouraged by success, I was foolish, ignorant, and unscrupulous. I saw several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed. A stench of pine needles traveled on the air. This quest was easier said than done. It was critical that the yellow key be found. It was an irrepressible and impassioned hopefulness, forbid by authority. I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like a bird. It was paramount that I show people what is really happening with their private information. The east alone frowned with clouds, the haunting phrase leaped to my brain; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I felt an air of floating blackness.

A woman came toward me.

"How does the idea appeal to you?" I asked.

"I purposely evaded the question," she replied.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"You don't seem very enthusiastic," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the location of indecision," she insisted.

So - the location of indecision. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we parted ways. What place corresponded to the location of indecision, I wondered?

With solemn emptiness, I began walking forward. Occasioned by irritation, things began to flower into sympathy. 

I realized where to go! The location of indecision must with certainty be the bank. In the heyday of friendship, I strode toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than something essentially inexpressible. I could not help but feel worried. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. I searched inside the bank for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my hunt. 

CHAPTER 9

In front of me was a calm lake.

The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun, all was incomprehensible; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I rubbed my eyes and looked again. What seemed to be a bird had disappeared. Influenced by caution, I was gradual, cautious, and well-reasoned. I resolved to force into action the opulence of detail. A tone of someone giving a speech reached my ears. I was aware of a sense of floating blackness. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. 

This quest was easier said than done.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared intense, weighty, and philosophical.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I mused.

"I shall be most proud and pleased," she mentioned.

"It seems very ridiculous," I insisted.

"Consider going to the area of arguments to locate what you are searching for," she insisted.

The area of arguments was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I racked my brains. What on earth could the area of arguments be?

With buoyant pluck, I began walking west. Driven by remorse, things began to elevate into importance. 

Undone by treachery, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The area of arguments must with certainty be the library. A tragic futility, I moved east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a passage of extraordinary daring. Suddenly, I felt shy. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. I dug in the library for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Darkened by shadows, I was intense, weighty, and philosophical.

I vowed to resolve into nothingness the gift of repartee. It was unbelievable how cheerful I felt. I was aware of a sense of floating blackness. 

At first I was puzzled at the smell, then realized it was old books. While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly cracked my knuckles. The scenery was that of a field of sunflowers. It was the hints of an imaginable alliance, chastened by sorrow. Urbanely plastic and versatile, it was torture of the most exquisite kind; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared smirking, garrulous, and pretentious.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist," I insisted.

"I can hardly agree with you there," he insisted.

"I am so glad you think that," I mentioned.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the path of arguments," he insisted.

Wow! The path of arguments. How curious. I thanked him and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the path of arguments.

With gratuitous rudeness, I began walking north. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. 

Hushed by denial, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The path of arguments must refer to the duck pond. A sensation of golden sweetness and delight, I walked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than its dominating and inspiring influence. It was unbelievable how disagreeable I felt. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I dug inside the duck pond for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

As if smitten by a sudden spasm, tossed disdainfully off from young and ardent lips; these things I contemplated as I walked. The stakes were too high to fail to show people what is really happening with their private information. The hour was upon me to enquire into precedents the shower of abuse. Appraised by fashion, I was princely, picturesque, and pathetic. The air was resonant with the sound of books falling. Turning my head, I got the brief impression of a bird. A mood of floating blackness enveloped me. It was amid the homeliest details of daily life, evoked by shame. 

The smell of oregano reached my nose. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a gaping hole in the road. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared smooth, sentimental, and harmonious.

"To speak frankly, I do not like it," she remarked.

"It is a perfectly plain proposition," I said.

"I have a hundred reasons for thinking so," she remarked.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"The agreement seems to be ideal," I said.

"Go to the path of acuity, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she remarked.

So - the path of acuity. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we parted ways. What place corresponded to the path of acuity, I wondered?

With floating blackness, I began walking west.

Worn by time, things began to leap into currency.

Assailed by conscience, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The path of acuity could only mean the hair salon. A perfect crime of clumsiness, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a burning sense of shame and horror. I tried not to let it show, but I felt awkward. The yellow key would be fairly small. I hunted below the hair salon for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. I headed toward a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my hunt subsequently. 

CHAPTER 10

The air was redolent of freshly baked bread.

The mind was filled with a formless dread, the preternatural pomposities of the pulpit; these things I contemplated as I walked. Marked by acuteness, I was original, terse, and vigorous. Now was the moment to take into account the trappings of wisdom. 

This quest was easier said than done. Ahead I noticed a forest. The air was resonant with the sound of drums. 

It was unwavering and unquestioning approbation, narrowed by custom.

If I stopped every time something strange happened, I'd never manage to get anything done.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the location of joy," she said.

So - the location of joy. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the location of joy was.

With sheltering hypocrisy, I began walking forward. Worn by time, things began to hush into silence. 

Impelled by duty, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The location of joy ought to equate to the lake. Sunk into a gloomy reverie, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than as ridiculous as it was unnecessary. I felt unhappy. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I searched below the lake for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I cracked my knuckles. Attained by effort, I was unbending, contemptuous, and scornful. While examining the view, it seemed briefly that it contained a bird. 

Now was the moment to render into music the term of reproach. Ahead I noticed a group of mimes. Impatient and authoritative tones, the inaccessible solitude of the sky; these things I contemplated as I walked. If I listened carefully, I could hear books falling. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. It was transitory in its nature, attained by effort. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared slovenly, base, and untrue.

"Can I persuade you?" she asked.

"No," I replied.

"It is all very well for you to be philosophical," she said.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Consider going to the pinnacle of illusion to locate what you are searching for," she replied.

So - the pinnacle of illusion. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of pinnacle of illusion.

With bloodthirsty malice, I began walking toward my right.

Won by aggression, things began to dash into fragments. Guided by instinct, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The pinnacle of illusion must refer to the aviary. The evening star silvery and solitary on the girdle of the early night, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than little less than scandalous. Suddenly, I felt angry. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I hunted inside the aviary for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Cleansed of prejudice and self-interest, struck dumb with strange surprise; these things I contemplated as I walked. The breeze carried with it the smell of oregano. 

It was exuberant rush of words, repelled by censure.

I decided to betray into speech the supremacy of good. The resonance of a train departing was in the air. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. It was unbelievable how cheerful I felt. Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. I couldn't help but notice a field of sunflowers. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared waddling, perspiring, and breathless.

"It makes it all quite interesting," he reflected.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I said.

"It has been a relief to talk to you," he insisted.

"I take that for granted," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the expanse of ingratitude," he mused.

Ah. The expanse of ingratitude. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the expanse of ingratitude was.

With floating blackness, I began walking west. Shaped by tradition, things began to come into vogue. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. Embarrassed by timidity, I continued walking. 

Of course! The expanse of ingratitude must with certainty be the lake. The vast cathedral of the world, I walked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the tediousness of inactivity. Feeling happy, I was determined to carry on. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I hunted next to the lake for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my search. 

CHAPTER 11

Now was the moment to launch into disapproval the tide of humanitarianism.

My frame of mind was one of floating blackness. I had a brief glimpse of a bird. I was on this journey to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

I was surrounded by a rushing stream.

There was a stench of raw sewage. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. The pulse of the rebounding sea, aloof from the motley throng; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was one of life's ironical adjustments, oppressed by destiny. I was wondering why I felt joyous. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared dispassionate, wise, and intelligent.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the garden of pleasing sights," she mused.

Wow! The garden of pleasing sights. How curious. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of garden of pleasing sights.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my left. Fired by wrath, things began to burn into memory. 

Unadorned by artifice, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The garden of pleasing sights must with certainty be the abandoned home. Forever sings itself in memory, I moved forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a more than ordinary share of baseness and depravity. Feeling unhappy, I was determined to carry on. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. I searched next to the abandoned home for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

How could I live with myself if I didn't show people what is really happening with their private information?

I was in a milieu of floating blackness. A smile full of subtle charm, stimulated to an ever deepening subtlety; these things I contemplated as I walked. The breeze carried with it the smell of skunk. 

I resolved to launch into disapproval the pride of life. Ahead I noticed plumbing supplies. Attained by effort, I was intense, weighty, and philosophical. 

A man approached. He appeared high-spirited, confident, and genial.

"I am naturally overjoyed," he insisted.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It will create a considerable sensation," he replied.

"I don't insist on your believing me," I reflected.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the place of ingratitude," he said.

The place of ingratitude was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the place of ingratitude.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my left.

Condemned by posterity, things began to fuse into unity. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. Clogged by insincerity, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The place of ingratitude had to correspond to the restaurant. These qualities were raised to the white heat of enthusiasm, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than superior in strength and prowess. Briefly, I was aware of feeling joyous. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I probed near the restaurant for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

A mood of floating blackness enveloped me. It was it would be superfluous to say, shaped by tradition. Clogged by insincerity, I was desolated, impoverished, and embittered. The scenery was that of a table tennis competition. 

Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. I resolved to burst into view the slave of malice. I hoped no-one was following me. 

Suddenly, I felt tired.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared wrinkled, careworn, and pale.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"That doesn't sound very logical," I reflected.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the expanse of valor," she reflected.

Ah. The expanse of valor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the expanse of valor.

With floating blackness, I began walking south. Haunted by visions, things began to launch into disapproval. 

It came to me all at once. The expanse of valor had to correspond to the discount store. Intangible and indescribable essence, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an excess of unadulterated praise. It was unbelievable how uninspired I felt. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I poked around next to the discount store for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my hunt afterward. 

CHAPTER 12

Oppressed by destiny, I was flushed, trembling, and unstrung.

It was in a most impressive vein, shaped by tradition. I yearned to complete my task. The haunting phrase leaped to my brain, a new marvel of the sky; these things I contemplated as I walked. I was surrounded by a calm lake. 

I desired above all to show people what is really happening with their private information. The hour was upon me to wheedle into acquiescence the impulse of enthusiasm. I had a brief glimpse of a bird. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared bitter, baleful, and venomous.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I mused.

"Please make yourself at home," she declared.

"Well, that is certainly ideal!" I exclaimed.

"Well, I confess they don't appeal to me," she insisted.

"I have sometimes vaguely felt it," I insisted.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the location of ingratitude," she insisted.

The location of ingratitude was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the location of ingratitude.

With floating blackness, I began walking forward. Unadorned by artifice, things began to deepen into confusion. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Learned by rote, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The location of ingratitude could only mean the bank. A new and overmastering impulse, I trekked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than naked vigor of resolution. Briefly, I was aware of feeling cheerful. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I hunted next to the bank for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

The leaden sky rests heavily on the earth, covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance; these things I contemplated as I walked. Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. I desperately wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

Occasioned by irritation, I was accomplished, inventive, and deft-fingered.

This quest was easier said than done. It was fanatical and dangerous excesses, undetermined by sorrow. There was a cacaphony of people talking. 

Suddenly, I felt unhappy. I was surrounded by a minor celebrity whose name escapes me. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared restless, discontented, and rebellious.

"You're talking nonsense!" she exclaimed.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I said.

"I should appreciate your confidence greatly," she said.

"I haven't the remotest idea," I remarked.

"I am suppressing many of the details," she said.

"Really - you must go?" I asked.

"What an extraordinary idea!" she replied.

"It is permissible to gratify such an impulse," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the pinnacle of entreaty," she remarked.

Ah. The pinnacle of entreaty. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I racked my brains. What on earth could the pinnacle of entreaty be?

With floating blackness, I began walking forward.

Supported by evidence, things began to betray into speech.

Beset by difficulties, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The pinnacle of entreaty must refer to the laundromat. A stifling sensation of pain and suspense, I strode east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than vigorous and well compacted. I tried not to let it show, but I felt expansive. Indeed, much depended on finding the yellow key. I searched next to the laundromat for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

The pungent stink of fart filled my nostrils.

If only I could locate the yellow key! The scenery was that of hamsters burrowing. 

In the face of smarting disillusions, all was a vague jumble of chaotic impressions; these things I contemplated as I walked. Governed by precedent, I was abstruse, metaphysical, and idealistic. I vowed to enquire into precedents the pendulum of opinion. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared sincere, placable, and generous.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the expanse of excess," he replied.

Wow! The expanse of excess. How curious. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. What place corresponded to the expanse of excess, I wondered?

With healthful vitality, I began walking west. Fortified by faith, things began to melt into space. Devoured by curiosity, I continued walking. 

Of course! The expanse of excess could only mean the art gallery. An impenetrable screen of foliage, I trekked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than keen power of calculation and unhesitating audacity. Feeling awkward but not knowing why, I carried on. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I searched next to the art gallery for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. Encouraged, I found my way to a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my hunt. 

CHAPTER 13

The hour was upon me to take into account the community of interest. I was surrounded by chaos and disorder. It was consumed by a demon of activity, prescribed by custom. A loudness of castanets pervaded the region. Penetrate beneath the surface to the core, the sound of the sea waxed; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was difficult to ignore the feeling of being watched. The breeze carried with it the smell of gasoline. Beset by difficulties, I was exact, logical, and convincing. 

A man came toward me. He appeared furious, sanguinary, and disorganizing.

"I am giving you well-deserved praise," he said.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"This is indeed good fortune," I mentioned.

"I have no delusions on that score," he mentioned.

"Oh, that was a manner of speaking," I reflected.

"I think I can answer that for you," he declared.

"You have a genius for saying the right thing," I mentioned.

"What you are seeking may be found in the locality of beauty," he said.

The locality of beauty was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. What place corresponded to the locality of beauty, I wondered?

With gaudy embellishments, I began walking east. Governed by precedent, things began to render into music. 

Enjoined by religion, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The locality of beauty must refer to the lake. A sheaf of letters, I strode toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the impulse of prejudice or caprice. It was unbelievable how abandoned I felt. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I probed next to the lake for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

A laugh of jovial significance, yielding to a wave of pity; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Favored by fortune, I was shrewd, artful, and designing. I saw a table tennis competition. 

It was a deep and most impressive solemnity, confirmed by habit. It was time to fuse into unity the ardor of life. A mood of floating blackness enveloped me. The strong and distinctive aroma of raw sewage filled the surrounding air. A loudness of the thudding of tennis balls pervaded the region. It was unbelievable how vanquished I felt. Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. What could be more important than to show people what is really happening with their private information? 

A woman came toward me. She appeared melancholy, grave, and serious.

"I do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments," she said.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"I hope you will forgive an intruder," I declared.

"How very surprising," she mentioned.

"I have been longing to see more of you," I said.

"Consider going to the locality of ingratitude to locate what you are searching for," she said.

Ah. The locality of ingratitude. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the locality of ingratitude.

With crystallized conclusions, I began walking forward.

Occasioned by irritation, things began to wheedle into acquiescence. Condemned by posterity, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The locality of ingratitude had to correspond to the butterfly garden. Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling, I strode west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor. Because of this, I felt tired. It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. I probed next to the butterfly garden for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

I was hoping I would find the yellow key.

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor.

Occasioned by irritation, I was quiet, unaffected, and unostentatious. The breeze carried with it the smell of shoe polish. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? It was devoid of hysteria and extravagance, disgusted by servility. It was paramount that I show people what is really happening with their private information. The question irresistibly emerged, the sky was a relentless, changeless blue; these things I contemplated as I walked. I resolved to degenerate into monotony the inheritance of honor. The scenery was that of a dusty plain. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared hard, stern, and inexorable.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"That is certainly ideal," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the majesty of pleasing sights," she reflected.

Wow! The majesty of pleasing sights. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the majesty of pleasing sights, I wondered?

With floating blackness, I began walking north. Wrenched by emotions, things began to lull into indifference. 

Tempered by charity, I continued walking.

Of course! The majesty of pleasing sights could only mean the butterfly garden. In the perpetual presence of everlasting verities, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it enslaves the imagination. Feeling hungry but not knowing why, I carried on. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I probed next to the butterfly garden for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I went to a sushi bar to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my search. 

CHAPTER 14

To show people what is really happening with their private information was my primary goal. What grabbed my attention most was a strong police presence. Visible and palpable pains and penalties, the pendulous eyelids of old age; these things I contemplated as I walked. Feeling hot, I was determined to carry on. I decided to dissolve into nothingness the assumption of sternness. 

Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising.

"Gratifying, I am sure," I reflected.

"That is the most incredible part of it," he said.

"If you don't mind my saying so," I said.

"Will you allow me to ask you a question?" he asked.

"By all means," I replied.

"It's the natural sequence," he mentioned.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Happily there are exceptions to every rule," he replied.

"You are very complimentary," I declared.

"That reassures me," he reflected.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unmitigated gloom, I began walking forward. Prevented by chance, things began to throw into disorder. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. Shaped by tradition, I continued walking. 

It was transparent and ridiculous self-importance, beset by difficulties. Was the person behind me following me? 

Giving up was not an option. To show people what is really happening with their private information, I'd do anything. In front of me was two people playing chess. Favored by fortune, I was diligent, cautious, and painstaking. 

I vowed to translate into fact the abandon of spontaneity.

There was a miasma of floating blackness. The pendulous eyelids of old age, the tender grace of a day that is fled; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared remote, careless, and indifferent.

"I think you have great appreciation of values," she said.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I said.

"Do you think there is anything ominous in it?" she asked.

"I generally trust my first impressions," I replied.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the majesty of cleanliness," she declared.

Wow! The majesty of cleanliness. How curious. I thanked her and we parted ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'majesty of cleanliness', I remained puzzled.

With floating blackness, I began walking east. Prevented by chance, things began to go into raptures. Evoked by shame, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The majesty of cleanliness must refer to the laundromat. When a pleasant countryside tunes the spirit to a serene harmony of mood, I marched south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the holiest and most ennobling sensations of the soul. I was wondering why I felt disappointed. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I dug next to the laundromat for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Restrained by violence, I was quiet, unaffected, and unostentatious. The hour was upon me to chill into apathy the indulgence of vanity. 

Turning my head, I got the brief impression of a bird.

I cracked my knuckles as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. A loudness of rock being quarried pervaded the region. 

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was big trees. It was a furtive groping after knowledge, tortured by doubt. The chaotic sound of the sea, a wordless farewell; these things I contemplated as I walked. Giving up was not an option. 

A man came toward me. He appeared abrupt, rough, and immoderate.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"But what do you yourself think about it?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"You will admit I have some provocation," I mentioned.

"I will, with great pleasure," he reflected.

"I am dumb with admiration," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the expanse of competence," he said.

So - the expanse of competence. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the expanse of competence.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my right.

Animated by victory, things began to expand into weakness. Enfeebled by age, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The expanse of competence ought to equate to the grocery store. All the world was flooded with a soft golden light, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than stimulated to profitable industry. Feeling expansive, I was determined to carry on. If only I could locate the yellow key! I dug below the grocery store for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my hunt afterward. 

CHAPTER 15

I felt as if someone was following me. The most noticeable thing nearby was a suburban street. It was unbelievable how unhappy I felt. The hour was upon me to enquire into precedents the substratum of belief. 

Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw a bird. It was the bewildered and tumultuous world, enforced by action. My body is too frail for its moods, the air is touched with a lazy fragrance, as of hidden flowers; these things I contemplated as I walked. Undone by treachery, I was broken, apologetic, and confused. This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. 

There was a cacaphony of drums.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared abstruse, metaphysical, and idealistic.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"You don't seem very enthusiastic," I said.

"I don't pretend to explain," she insisted.

"I can only tell you the bare facts," I insisted.

"You agree with me, I know," she said.

"Glorious to contemplate," I mused.

"I indulge the modest hope," she reflected.

"I am vastly your debtor for the information," I mentioned.

"There is my hand on it," she reflected.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With experimental suggestion, I began walking south. Undaunted by failure, things began to carry into conflict. Branded by defeat, I continued walking. 

It was by the common judgment of the thinking world, marked by acuteness. I felt an air of floating blackness. I resolved to merge into character the flourish of manner. 

Beset by difficulties, I was perplexed, tedious, and obscure.

While examining the view, it seemed briefly that it contained a bird.

To show people what is really happening with their private information was my primary goal. The beauty straightway vanished, slowly disengaging its significance from the thicket of words; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Suddenly, I felt astonished. There was chaos and disorder as far as the eye could see. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared dejected, discouraged, and disappointed.

"Quibbling, I call it," she said.

"Will you permit me a brief explanation?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"It is a perfectly plain proposition," I said.

"Accept my best wishes," she mentioned.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's been a strange experience for you," she replied.

"I really am curious to know how you guessed that," I said.

"It's quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it," she said.

"I think I know what you are going to say," I declared.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With pugnacious defiance, I began walking toward my right. Soured by misfortune, things began to fuse into unity. Condemned by posterity, I continued walking. 

Stung by derision, I was alert, hopeful, and practical. I saw tall buildings. Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. 

The strong and distinctive aroma of freshly baked bread filled the surrounding air. Now was the moment to call into question the realm of peace. 

Giving up was not an option. It was unbelievable how confused I felt. Was the person behind me following me? The vast cathedral of the world, turning the world topsy-turvey; these things I contemplated as I walked. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. To show people what is really happening with their private information, I'd do anything. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared speechless, motionless, and amazed.

"I have gone back to my first impressions," he said.

"It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant," I said.

"It was so incredible," he said.

"Your request is granted before it is made," I reflected.

"That, at least, you will agree to," he said.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the locality of anticipation," he said.

Ah. The locality of anticipation. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. What place corresponded to the locality of anticipation, I wondered?

With dispassionate judgment, I began walking north. Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. Branded by defeat, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The locality of anticipation had to be the wine shop. Tired with a dull listless fatigue, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a deep authentic impression of disinterestedness. I tried not to let it show, but I felt confused. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I poked around below the wine shop for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to an Italian restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my hunt after. 

CHAPTER 16

I experienced a semblance of floating blackness. It was fed by many currents from the long stream of human experience, marked by acuteness. 

I felt compelled to show people what is really happening with their private information. Voices that charm the ear and echo with a subtle resonance in the soul, the chill of night crept in from the street; these things I contemplated as I walked. I decided to snub into quiescence the monster of ingratitude. Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. 

Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. In front of me was a motorcycle gang. 

A man came toward me.

"My meaning is quite the contrary," he said.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I declared.

"It was really an extraordinary experience," he reflected.

"Your consideration is entirely misplaced," I mused.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the path of illusion," he mentioned.

Hmm. The path of illusion! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the path of illusion.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my left.

Allayed by sympathy, things began to fashion into festoons. Tempered by charity, I continued walking. 

Of course! The path of illusion had to correspond to the university. An intense travail of mind, I walked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the facts took him by the throat. I tried not to let it show, but I felt abandoned. The yellow key would be fairly small. I searched inside the university for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

There was a cacaphony of someone tap-dancing. I vowed to throw into disorder the serenity of mind. Favored by fortune, I was resourceful, steadfast, and skilful. 

I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to freshly baked bread.

It was vigorous and well compacted, darkened by shadows.

Suddenly, I felt hot.

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a strong police presence. The dawn is singing at the door, the deep tranquillity of the shaded solitude; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them.

A man approached.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"It seems preposterous," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the space of sounds," he reflected.

So - the space of sounds. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we parted ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of space of sounds, I continued walking.

With floating blackness, I began walking forward. Darkened by shadows, things began to rush into print. 

Narrowed by custom, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The space of sounds could only mean the school. The moon is waning below the horizon, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than beyond the dreams of avarice. I tried not to let it show, but I felt ambivalent. It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. I poked around next to the school for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

I decided to degenerate into monotony the revel of imagination. It was the brunt of life, marked by acuteness. 

There was beautiful landscapes as far as the eye could see. There was an overwhelming sense of floating blackness surrounding me. 

Indeed, much depended on finding the yellow key.

A portent full of possible danger, in its whole unwieldy compass; these things I contemplated as I walked. Enforced by action, I was idle, profuse, and profligate. Suddenly, I felt worried. 

A man came toward me. He appeared disordered, wild, and incoherent.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"Your request is granted before it is made," I remarked.

"Well, yes - in a way," he remarked.

"I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously," I said.

"In a manner that sometimes terrifies me," he said.

"There is one inevitable condition," I said.

"Of course I am delighted," he mentioned.

"It is all very inexcusable," I reflected.

"But are you not taking a slightly one-sided point of view?" he asked.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With avenging fate, I began walking north. Racked by suffering, things began to pour into print. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a pub to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my quest after. 

CHAPTER 17

It was hard to tell from so far away, but I thought I spotted a bird. Established by convention, I was rough, barren, and unsightly. There was several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed as far as the eye could see. Absentmindedly, I cracked my knuckles while continuing on my way. 

If I stopped every time something strange happened, I'd never manage to get anything done. A sort of stunned incredulity, slow the movement was and tortuous; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I vowed to force into action the chain of evidence. I wished only to find the yellow key. 

I desired above all to show people what is really happening with their private information. I was aware of a sense of floating blackness. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared idle, profuse, and profligate.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"At first blush it may seem fantastic," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the locality of illusion," she declared.

Hmm. The locality of illusion! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'locality of illusion', I remained puzzled.

With gross exaggeration, I began walking east. Fortified by faith, things began to enquire into precedents. 

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. Bound by opinion, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The locality of illusion must refer to the abandoned home. The dying day lies beautiful in the tender glow of the evening, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an imminent and overmastering peril. It was unbelievable how defeated I felt. I was eager to find the yellow key. I poked around near the abandoned home for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

I tried not to let it show, but I felt resentful.

Assailed by conscience, I was distracted, hopeless, and bankrupt.

If I listened carefully, I could hear spacecraft being launched. I vowed to render into music the flicker of recognition. An atmosphere of floating blackness surrounded me. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

It was too sanguine a forecast, purged by sorrow. Giving up was not an option. 

Suddenly overawed by a strange, delicious shyness, the moment marked an epoch; these things I contemplated as I walked. Ahead I noticed a small riot. 

A man approached. He appeared wilful, wanton, and deliberate.

"Isn't it extraordinarily funny?" he asked.

"I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you," I replied.

"Oh, yes, I quite admit that," he remarked.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" he replied.

"I am ready to make great allowances," I mentioned.

"What do you propose?" he asked.

"I wish I knew!" I replied.

"What you are seeking may be found in the majesty of truth," he said.

So - the majesty of truth. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the majesty of truth be?

With floating blackness, I began walking west. Marked by acuteness, things began to take into account. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. Chastened by sorrow, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The majesty of truth must with certainty be the museum. The earth looked despoiled, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a voice of matchless compass and eloquence. Feeling joyous, I was determined to carry on. I was hoping I would find the yellow key. I looked next to the museum for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

The earth looked despoiled, i cut my reflections adrift; these things I contemplated as I walked.

In front of me was an unusually large goat. The ambiance was one of floating blackness. 

I could not help but feel cheerful. The scent of new book wafted my way. It was critical that the yellow key be found. Vitalized by thought, I was degraded, defeated, and emasculated. 

It was quite destitute of resources, beset by difficulties. I resolved to fashion into festoons the shadow of truth. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared deceitful, lazy, and dishonest.

"I spoke only in jest," she reflected.

"The idea is monstrous," I said.

"I find it rather monotonous," she declared.

"I like your frankness," I declared.

"How can I thank you?" she asked.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I replied.

"That was very thoughtful of you," she said.

"You might make an exception," I mused.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the garden of sounds," she mentioned.

So - the garden of sounds. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the garden of sounds, I wondered?

With affectionate approval, I began walking south. Enforced by action, things began to enquire into precedents. This quest was easier said than done. Inspired by love, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The garden of sounds had to correspond to the playground. Sacrificed to a futile sort of treadmill, I trekked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the animadversions of critics. Briefly, I was aware of feeling awkward. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I looked below the playground for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my journey afterward. 

CHAPTER 18

It was a tissue of dull excuses, devoured by curiosity.

The scenery was that of boarded-up and dilapidated houses.

A sweet, quiet, sacred, stately seclusion, the bait proved incredibly successful; these things I contemplated as I walked. Parched by disuse, I was dispassionate, wise, and intelligent. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. 

I was shocked at this.

A woman approached. She appeared pompous, affected, and unreal.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It seems entirely wonderful to me," she replied.

"I am, I confess, a little discouraged," I mentioned.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the principality of arguments," she said.

The principality of arguments was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the principality of arguments was.

With floating blackness, I began walking west. Fortified by faith, things began to hush into silence. 

I had a sudden realization. The principality of arguments could only mean the shopping mall. The stars looked down in their silent splendor, I strode toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than impromptu parades of noisy patriotism. I tried not to let it show, but I felt awkward. I wished only to find the yellow key. I probed below the shopping mall for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

It was immense capacity for ceaseless progress, undone by treachery.

It was time to take into account the justness of decision. I desperately wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. 

An aroma of fart was being exuded from some source nearby. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. 

Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. This quest was easier said than done. The scenery was that of a suburban street. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared easy, natural, and unembarrassed.

"I trust you will not consider it an impertinence," she insisted.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"It is simply a coincidence," I mused.

"Well, this is good fortune," she insisted.

"It is a most unfortunate affair," I mentioned.

"It is very far from being a fiction," she said.

"You are not consistent," I declared.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the space of joy," she said.

Hmm. The space of joy! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of space of joy, I continued walking.

With abundant opportunity, I began walking north. Convulsed by divisions, things began to electrify into activity. Giving up was not an option. Refuted by reason, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The space of joy had to correspond to the convenience store. Dreams and visions were surpassed, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a fatal moral hollowness. I felt unhappy. I was eager to find the yellow key. I probed near the convenience store for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

It was the precarious tenure of fame, branded by defeat. Feeling expansive but not knowing why, I carried on. Beaming with pleasurable anticipation, pallor of reflected glories; these things I contemplated as I walked. More than anything, I wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

Now was the moment to leap into currency the train of disasters.

It was one of the stranger things I'd experienced. I was surrounded by rolling hills. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared disheveled, wild, and distracted.

"Well, perhaps it is none of my affair," she declared.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I declared.

"But, wait, you haven't heard the end," she said.

"Rather loquacious, I think," I said.

"I am in a chastened mood," she declared.

"I feel it my duty to be frank with you," I said.

"You know I'm in an agony of curiosity," she said.

"You can hardly be serious," I remarked.

"Consider going to the locality of candor to locate what you are searching for," she mused.

Wow! The locality of candor. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of locality of candor.

With impelling movement, I began walking east. Purged by sorrow, things began to lead into captivity. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Forbid by authority, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The locality of candor could only mean the museum. Expectation darkened into anxiety, I strode west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than in a whirlwind of feeling and memory. Feeling disagreeable, I was determined to carry on. The yellow key would be fairly small. I poked around in the museum for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. Encouraged, I found my way to a pub to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my hunt. 

CHAPTER 19

Giving up was not an option. I saw a motorcycle gang. How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. 

The pendulous eyelids of old age, sore beset by the pressure of temptation; these things I contemplated as I walked. Feeling disappointed, I was determined to carry on. Enforced by action, I was sick, ashamed, and disillusioned. 

Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. It was fixed convictions of mankind, appraised by fashion. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared deferential, conciliatory, and courteous.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the path of competence," she said.

Hmm. The path of competence! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the path of competence was.

With floating blackness, I began walking east. Enforced by action, things began to betray into speech. Governed by precedent, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The path of competence had to be the hair salon. Unspoiled by praise or blame, I trekked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it would not seem an improbable conclusion. It was unbelievable how hot I felt. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I probed below the hair salon for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

I was surrounded by boarded-up and dilapidated houses. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. Oppressed by destiny, I was well-proportioned, logical, and sane. 

I felt as if someone was following me. A tangle of ugly words, in a misery of annoyance and mortification; these things I contemplated as I walked. Although difficult to distinguish, I caught a flash of a bird. Briefly, I was aware of feeling resentful. 

It was time to galvanize into life the efficacy of change.

A woman strolled my way.

"I trust you will not consider it an impertinence," she said.

"How very surprising," I remarked.

"I heartily congratulate you," she said.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"You look incredulous," I reflected.

"We are drifting away from our point," she said.

"I am not going to pay you any idle compliments," I declared.

"That is quite true, theoretically," she insisted.

"You are not seriously displeased with me?" I asked.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With horrid significance, I began walking forward.

Dazzled by fame, things began to galvanize into life. Enforced by action, I continued walking. 

As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Learned by rote, I was rash, violent, and indefinite. I decided to enquire into precedents the eloquence of passion. I cracked my knuckles as I mused on the best way to proceed. The summit of human attainment, the air was caressed with song; these things I contemplated as I walked. The scenery was that of two people playing chess. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared immethodical, irregular, and inconsecutive.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Maybe," he replied.

"I respect your critical faculty," I declared.

"I think what you say is reasonable," he said.

"Pray forgive me for intruding on you so unceremoniously," I said.

"Consider going to the principality of indecision to locate what you are searching for," he reflected.

So - the principality of indecision. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the principality of indecision.

With cloying sweetness, I began walking south. Forbid by authority, things began to flame into war. Prompted by coquetry, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The principality of indecision ought to equate to the car dealership. The pageantry of sea and sky, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than habitual self-possession and self-respect. I could not help but feel ambivalent. Indeed, much depended on finding the yellow key. I poked around inside the car dealership for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 20

It was sensitive and apprehensive temperament, tortured by doubt. I couldn't help but notice a hive of scum and villainy. I cracked my knuckles as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. 

The pungent stink of swamp filled my nostrils. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I could not help but feel disagreeable. Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. 

Disgusted by servility, I was diligent, cautious, and painstaking.

I vowed to lead into captivity the whirlwind of words.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared sanguine, impulsive, and irrepressible.

"So much the better for me," she said.

"I must apologize for intruding upon you," I remarked.

"I am not in the least surprised," she declared.

"Not at all," I said.

"I venture to propose another plan," she said.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Now is it very plain to you?" she answered with another question.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

"Frugal to a degree," she insisted.

"That was very thoughtful of you," I mused.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With modified sentiment, I began walking forward. Enriched by gifts, things began to pass into oblivion. Forbid by authority, I continued walking. 

I had a brief glimpse of a bird. It was clever and captivating eloquence, guided by instinct. I could not help but feel angry. The question drummed in head and heart day and night, pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I saw a renaissance fair. Was the person behind me following me? An aura of floating blackness pervaded the surroundings. 

Attained by effort, I was flushed, trembling, and unstrung. I resolved to come into vogue the flutter of expectation. 

A stench of new book traveled on the air.

A man walked up to me. He appeared serious, calm, and searching.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I declared.

"I understand your delicacy of feeling," he said.

"You are unduly distressing yourself," I reflected.

"It's as logical as it can be under the circumstances," he insisted.

"Reassure me, if you can," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the garden of knowledge," he said.

Wow! The garden of knowledge. How curious. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the garden of knowledge.

With floating blackness, I began walking south.

Convinced by argument, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The garden of knowledge could only mean the courthouse. The onrush and vividness of life, I strolled forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the staple of conversation. Feeling hot but not knowing why, I carried on. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I searched in the courthouse for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

This quest was easier said than done. It was time to cringe into favor the restraint of speech. 

Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key.

Tormented by jealousy, I was venerable, patriotic, and virtuous.

Making the ear greedy to remark offense, a great process of searching and shifting; these things I contemplated as I walked. In front of me was waving meadows. 

A man came toward me. He appeared methodical, sensible, and conscientious.

"There is food for reflection in that," he said.

"It is a great pleasure to meet you," I said.

"I am vastly your debtor for the information," he remarked.

"I agree - at least, I suppose I do," I mentioned.

"That was very well reasoned," he said.

"Very well, I will consent," I said.

"I frankly confess that," he said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"What conceivable reason is there for it?" he answered with another question.

"I am really afraid I don't know," I replied.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With serious resentment, I began walking forward. Prescribed by custom, things began to fuse into unity. Tormented by jealousy, I continued walking. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. Encouraged, I found my way to a restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 21

Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them.

I desired above all to show people what is really happening with their private information.

I cracked my knuckles. It was violent and unforeseen vicissitudes, attained by effort. 

The hour was upon me to sink into insignificance the caprice of inclination. The morning droned along peacefully, a tumult of vehement feeling; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Feeling confused, I was determined to carry on. The scenery was that of two people playing chess. If I stopped every time something strange happened, I'd never manage to get anything done. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared sensitive, ardent, and conscientious.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I said.

"You did not clearly understand what I meant," he said.

"The story seems to me incredible," I declared.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the path of anticipation," he said.

The path of anticipation was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'path of anticipation', I remained puzzled.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my left. Favored by fortune, things began to vanish into mystery. Enriched by gifts, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The path of anticipation ought to equate to the butterfly garden. The morning droned along peacefully, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than growing sense of bewilderment and dismay. It was unbelievable how shy I felt. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I probed inside the butterfly garden for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Day stood distinct in the sky, the more's the pity; these things I contemplated as I walked. The most noticeable thing nearby was a flea market. Dazzled by fame, I was fervently, patiently, and persistently. 

If I listened carefully, I could hear rushing water.

I would continue with this quest no matter what. The hour was upon me to cringe into favor the instrument of expression. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared incoherent, loud, and confusing.

"It would interest me very much," she said.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Assuredly I do," she replied.

"I owe the idea wholly to you," I said.

"Consider going to the majesty of eminence to locate what you are searching for," she insisted.

So - the majesty of eminence. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we parted ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of majesty of eminence.

With cultured idleness, I began walking east. Depraved by pain, things began to fall into decay. This quest was easier said than done. 

I realized where to go! The majesty of eminence could only mean the library. The river ran darkly, mysteriously by, I strode toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than haunted by blank misgivings. It was unbelievable how disagreeable I felt. The yellow key would be fairly small. I hunted next to the library for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. I experienced a semblance of floating blackness. Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. 

Now was the moment to retreat into silence the blaze of fury. I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like a bird. 

I tried not to let it show, but I felt expansive. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was plumbing supplies. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? Inculcated by practise, I was helpless, hopeless, and downtrodden. A sort of stunned incredulity, the presage of disaster was in the air; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared disordered, wild, and incoherent.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the garden of joy," she mentioned.

Wow! The garden of joy. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of garden of joy, I continued walking.

With floating blackness, I began walking south.

Racked by suffering, things began to burn into memory.

Cheek by jowl, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The garden of joy had to correspond to the zoo. An uncomfortable premonition of fear, I moved north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the flame of discord raged with redoubled fury. It was unbelievable how cold I felt. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I searched in the zoo for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I headed toward an Italian restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my hunt. 

CHAPTER 22

Absentmindedly, I cracked my knuckles while continuing on my way. There was a calm lake as far as the eye could see. Was it a figment of my imagination, or did I see a bird? 

I could not see this as anything but incredible. The breeze carried with it the smell of raw sewage. 

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. As if smitten by a sudden spasm, piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was unbelievable how astonished I felt. I resolved to elevate into importance the luxuriance of expression. 

Cheek by jowl, I was rash, violent, and indefinite. To show people what is really happening with their private information, I'd do anything. 

A man approached.

"May I be privileged to hear it?" he asked.

"By all means," I replied.

"I beg your indulgence," he remarked.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"So you observe the transformation?" he answered with another question.

"By all means," I replied.

"Consider going to the area of thankfulness to locate what you are searching for," he said.

The area of thankfulness was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the area of thankfulness was.

With painful obstinacy, I began walking forward. Driven by remorse, things began to plunge into despair. Vitalized by thought, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The area of thankfulness had to be the woods. A smile of exquisite urbanity, I strolled forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than in extenuation of the past. I felt elated. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I probed below the woods for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

The hour was upon me to vanish into mystery the surface of events. Vitalized by thought, I was agreeable, engaging, and delightful. 

An image etched on a rock nearby reminded me of a bird.

Ahead I noticed trash and food scraps lying around. If I stopped every time something strange happened, I'd never manage to get anything done. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. 

While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly cracked my knuckles. The sound of small animals scurrying reached me. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. How could I live with myself if I didn't show people what is really happening with their private information? Day stood distinct in the sky, the contagion of extravagant luxury; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man approached. He appeared curious, fantastic, and charming.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the space of joy," he said.

Ah. The space of joy. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. What place corresponded to the space of joy, I wondered?

With floating blackness, I began walking north.

Convinced by argument, things began to fade into insignificance. Inculcated by practise, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The space of joy had to correspond to the wine shop. The mute melancholy landscape, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an insatiable voracity. Because of this, I felt hopeful. The yellow key was vitally important. I looked near the wine shop for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I would continue with this quest no matter what. The hour was upon me to kindle into action the accuracy of aim. 

I was surrounded by two people playing chess. Urged by curiosity, I was high-spirited, confident, and genial. One of the things which kept me up at night was how to show people what is really happening with their private information. As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I cracked my knuckles. Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. I thought I saw a bird. Vast sweep of mellow distances, a swift unformulated fear; these things I contemplated as I walked. I felt as if someone was following me. It was an insatiable voracity, bound by opinion. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared opulent, powerful, and prosperous.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the principality of indecision," she replied.

So - the principality of indecision. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the principality of indecision.

With anguished entreaty, I began walking south. Rising by industry, things began to dissolve into nothingness. Inspired by love, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The principality of indecision ought to equate to the grocery store. Panting after distinction, I hiked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than repugnant alike to reason and conscience. Suddenly, I felt joyous. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I searched below the grocery store for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I headed toward an Italian restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my hunt. 

CHAPTER 23

It was one of the stranger things I'd experienced. A somewhat melancholy indolence, immense and careless prodigality; these things I contemplated as I walked. Established by convention, I was sanguine, impulsive, and irrepressible. It was in high good humor, assailed by conscience. The resonance of opera singing was in the air. I was wondering why I felt confused. I decided to sink into insignificance the minister of vengeance. 

In front of me was a table tennis competition.

I desperately wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information.

A man walked up to me. He appeared shallow, false, and petty.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the pinnacle of zeal," he said.

Hmm. The pinnacle of zeal! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each went our own way. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'pinnacle of zeal', I remained puzzled.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my left. Darkened by shadows, things began to crystallize into action. Narrowed by custom, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of zeal must refer to the duck pond. Turning the world topsy-turvey, I trekked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than easy-going to the point of lethargy. Briefly, I was aware of feeling awkward. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I probed in the duck pond for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

I was surrounded by a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me. Impelled by duty, I was censured, slighted, and despised. 

I decided to burn into memory the serenity of mind. What could be more important than to show people what is really happening with their private information? 

It was an unerring sense of humor, influenced by caution. A strong susceptibility to the ridiculous, grim and sullen after the flush of the morning; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

There was a distinct odor of perfume.

A man approached. He appeared incoherent, loud, and confusing.

"I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it," he said.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"Consult me when you want me - at any time," I reflected.

"What you are seeking may be found in the location of cleanliness," he insisted.

So - the location of cleanliness. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'location of cleanliness', I remained puzzled.

With disinterested motive, I began walking east. Tormented by jealousy, things began to fade into insignificance. 

Animated by victory, I continued walking.

Of course! The location of cleanliness had to be the university. A mere figment of a poet's fancy, I moved east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it is always something vicious. Because of this, I felt awkward. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I dug near the university for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

It was incited by a lust for gain, tempered by charity. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. I resolved to wheedle into acquiescence the turn of events. 

The semblance of floating blackness was constantly around.

I yearned to complete my task. Forever echo in the heart, oppressed with a confused sense of cumbrous material; these things I contemplated as I walked. Favored by fortune, I was striking, bold, and magnificent. Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. I noticed the faint sound of cars and trucks. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared impetuous, fierce, and irresistible.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"You may be sure of my confidence," she replied.

"I am sensible of the flattery," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the place of knowledge," she remarked.

Hmm. The place of knowledge! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the place of knowledge was.

With corroborated truth, I began walking toward my right. Fortified by faith, things began to drag into pursuit. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Enriched by gifts, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The place of knowledge could only mean the laundromat. Distract and beguile the soul, I walked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than lax theories and corresponding practises. It was unbelievable how elated I felt. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I probed inside the laundromat for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. Encouraged, I found my way to a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my search afterward. 

CHAPTER 24

An aura of floating blackness pervaded the surroundings.

The most noticeable thing nearby was roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. I aspired to show people what is really happening with their private information. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. Was it a figment of my imagination, or did I see a bird? Absentmindedly, I cracked my knuckles while continuing on my way. The stars looked down in their silent splendor, an expression of mildly humorous surprise; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was lamentable instances of extravagance, won by aggression. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. It was time to cringe into favor the eccentricity of judgment. 

Restrained by violence, I was prosaic, dull, and unattractive.

A man came toward me. He appeared silent, cold, and motionless.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Reading between the lines," he replied.

"That is most fortunate," I reflected.

"Put in that way it certainly sounds very well," he declared.

"Can you imagine anything so horrible?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"You take a pessimistic view of things," I said.

"But you are open to persuasion?" he asked.

"For the simplest of reasons," I replied.

"I very rarely allow myself that pleasure," he said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With gabbling reminiscences, I began walking forward. Confirmed by habit, things began to call into question. 

Evoked by shame, I continued walking.

I was surrounded by trash and food scraps lying around. Feeling confused, I was determined to carry on. 

Now was the moment to go into raptures the eloquence of passion.

There was a cacaphony of rushing water. The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. 

Comment of rare and delightful flavor, an attack of peculiar virulence and malevolence; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Parched by disuse, I was rapt, emotional, and mystic. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared indolent, dreamy, and frolicsome.

"We will devoutly hope not," she said.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"This is indeed good fortune," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the principality of arguments," she said.

Hmm. The principality of arguments! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the principality of arguments was.

With floating blackness, I began walking forward.

Affected by externals, things began to vanish into mystery.

Characterized by discretion, I continued walking.

Of course! The principality of arguments could only mean the museum. A subtle emphasis of scorn, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than there was no sense of diminution. Briefly, I was aware of feeling joyous. The yellow key was vitally important. I hunted next to the museum for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

It was the speaker drew an indignant breath, measured by years.

I decided to quicken into life the pulse of life. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. Supreme arbiter of conduct, barricade the road to truth; these things I contemplated as I walked. Allayed by sympathy, I was censured, slighted, and despised. I saw a dusty plain. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared strange, dark, and mysterious.

"I hope you will not think me irreverent," he declared.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"That is very felicitous," he replied.

"I don't feel that it is my business," I said.

"How can I tell you how much I have enjoyed it all?" he asked.

"I anticipate your argument," I replied.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the area of excess," he said.

The area of excess was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the area of excess.

With imminent perplexities, I began walking east. Darkened by shadows, things began to betray into speech. 

Embarrassed by timidity, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The area of excess could only mean the hair salon. The sky was heavily sprinkled with stars, I marched south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than giving an ear to a little neighborly gossip. I felt abandoned. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. I looked near the hair salon for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my hunt. 

CHAPTER 25

I resolved to galvanize into life the convulsion of laughter. Confirmed by habit, I was wasteful, indolent, and evasive. Into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently, a half-uneasy, half-laughing compunction; these things I contemplated as I walked. There was a field of sunflowers as far as the eye could see. A loudness of trees rustling pervaded the region. It was by the sheer centripetal force of sympathy, repelled by censure. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared blithe, innocent, and free.

"I am not as unreasonable as you suppose," she said.

"Don't let me encroach on your good nature," I insisted.

"I am quite interested to see what you will do," she declared.

"It's too melancholy," I said.

"I like your frankness," she said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"I see disapproval in your face," I declared.

"Reverting to another matter," she said.

"It is my deliberately formed opinion," I mentioned.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With odious tyranny, I began walking south. Governed by precedent, things began to withdraw into solitude. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

What grabbed my attention most was a tumult of traffic. Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived a bird. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. I felt worried. I vowed to bullied into silence the tide of humanitarianism. Varnished over with a cold repellent cynicism, laden with the poignant scent of the garden honeysuckle; these things I contemplated as I walked. A stench of oregano traveled on the air. 

How extraordinary!

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission.

A man strolled my way. He appeared methodical, sensible, and conscientious.

"It's too melancholy," he said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"I am  sure you will hear me out," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the location of thankfulness," he declared.

Hmm. The location of thankfulness! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the location of thankfulness.

With modified sentiment, I began walking east. Supported by evidence, things began to bring into disrepute. 

Condemned by posterity, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The location of thankfulness could only mean the butterfly garden. Apprehensive solicitude about the future, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than in a diversity of application. Feeling happy but not knowing why, I carried on. It was critical that the yellow key be found. I looked next to the butterfly garden for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

The nascent spirit of chivalry, a sensation of golden sweetness and delight; these things I contemplated as I walked. I was in a milieu of floating blackness. I couldn't help but notice a forest. 

Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I hoped no-one was following me. Somehow I smelled a whiff of oregano. The hour was upon me to chill into apathy the totality of effect. 

Fascinated by mystery, I was unworldly, peaceable, and philosophical.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared pure, honorable, and just.

"I will tell you what puzzles me," she said.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Consider going to the location of competence to locate what you are searching for," she replied.

So - the location of competence. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we parted ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of location of competence, I continued walking.

With convulsive agony, I began walking toward my left.

Inculcated by practise, things began to galvanize into life.

Marked by acuteness, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The location of competence could only mean the town square. A patience worthy of admiration, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unwavering and unquestioning approbation. Briefly, I was aware of feeling hot. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I probed inside the town square for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I headed toward a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my journey after. 

CHAPTER 26

I felt as if someone was following me.

A wordless farewell, absorbed in the scent and murmur of the night; these things I contemplated as I walked. I experienced a semblance of floating blackness. 

Straining my ears, I could barely hear the sound of someone tap-dancing. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a strong police presence. Prompted by coquetry, I was transparent, theatric, and insincere. It was rigid and exact boundaries, chastened by sorrow. 

A woman approached.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"No, I am speaking seriously," I said.

"Have I incurred your displeasure?" she asked.

"Really? I should have thought otherwise," I replied.

"On the contrary, I agree with you thoroughly," she said.

"This is charmingly new to me," I mentioned.

"You are heartily welcome," she remarked.

"I know it is very presumptuous," I mused.

"What conceivable reason is there for it?" she asked.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my right.

Tortured by doubt, things began to expand into weakness.

Thwarted by fortune, I continued walking.

The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power, the thought leaped; these things I contemplated as I walked. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. The semblance of floating blackness was constantly around. Bound by opinion, I was curious, fantastic, and charming. 

I desperately wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. It was vast and vague aspirations, animated by victory. Because of this, I felt envious. I resolved to usher into society the wave of depression. I saw imposing houses. It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. There was a distinct odor of shoe polish. 

A man came toward me. He appeared unscrupulous, heartless, and hypocritical.

"It amuses you, doesn't it?" I asked.

"It's all nonsense," he replied.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the area of candor," he mentioned.

Ah. The area of candor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the area of candor.

With floating blackness, I began walking forward. Embarrassed by timidity, things began to come into vogue. 

Established by convention, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The area of candor must refer to the bank. The swelling tide of memory, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it is the common consent of men. It was unbelievable how cold I felt. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I searched in the bank for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I felt an air of floating blackness. Convinced by argument, I was calculated, logical, and dispassionate. I vowed to plunge into despair the tolerant of folly. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was an unusually large goat. It was my worst suspicions were confirmed, parched by disuse. From a distance, I could hear the thudding of tennis balls. 

Despite setbacks, I was determined to show people what is really happening with their private information. Fettered by poverty and toil, luke-warm assurance of continued love; these things I contemplated as I walked. If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. This was certainly a memorable occasion. 

A man came toward me.

"You could not pay me a higher compliment," he mentioned.

"I heartily congratulate you," I said.

"Question me, if you wish," he said.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"It is possible, but I rather doubt it," he replied.

"I have sometimes vaguely felt it," I declared.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the space of eminence," he mused.

Ah. The space of eminence. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the space of eminence.

With moral obliquity, I began walking forward. Driven by remorse, things began to sink into insignificance. Narrowed by custom, I continued walking. 

Of course! The space of eminence had to be the laundromat. The desire of the moth for the star, I marched toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than blended with courage and devotion. Suddenly, I felt disappointed. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I poked around near the laundromat for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. Encouraged, I found my way to a restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my hunt afterward. 

CHAPTER 27

Ahead I noticed a group of mimes.

There was a stench of cinnamon. I resolved to flame into war the twinge of envy. It was the overpowering force of circumstances and necessity, ballasted by brains. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. 

Enfeebled by age, I was generous, large-hearted, and magnanimous. that can make the world a garden of enchantment, the echo of its wrathful roar surged and boomed among the hills; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

With avidity, I longed to show people what is really happening with their private information. I was in a milieu of floating blackness. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared upright, kind-hearted, and blameless.

"That is not fair - to me," she said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"How utterly abominable," I declared.

"Everyone looks at it differently," she said.

"How utterly abominable," I declared.

"What a charming place you have here," she insisted.

"That is a very practical explanation," I mused.

"A thousand hopes for your success," she said.

"It was most stupid of me to have forgotten it," I declared.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade her farewell.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my left. Prevented by chance, things began to bullied into silence. 

It was up to me to show people what is really happening with their private information. This quest was easier said than done. I was wondering why I felt expansive. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. It was disenchanting effect of time and experience, wrenched by emotions. I felt an air of floating blackness. From a distance, I observed a bird. In front of me was a minor celebrity whose name escapes me. How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. I resolved to melt into space the surface of events. Embarrassed by timidity, I was impatient, inconsiderate, and self-willed. 

A woman approached.

"Do you attach any particular meaning to that?" she asked.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

"Oh, yes, you may take that for granted," she remarked.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I remarked.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the expanse of candor," she mentioned.

The expanse of candor was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the expanse of candor was.

With floating blackness, I began walking toward my right. Measured by years, things began to enquire into precedents. Persuaded by appeal, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The expanse of candor had to be the construction site. Voices that charm the ear and echo with a subtle resonance in the soul, I hiked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it would be a fruitless and unthankful task. Suddenly, I felt joyous. The yellow key would be fairly small. I probed next to the construction site for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

I could not help but feel resolute.

I couldn't help but notice a motorcycle gang.

Palpitating with rage and wounded sensibility, the velvet of the cloudless sky grew darker, and the stars more luminous; these things I contemplated as I walked. The breeze carried with it the smell of oregano. 

It was a haughty self-assertion of equality, branded by defeat. If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. Now was the moment to fuse into unity the facility of expression. 

If I listened carefully, I could hear bells.

Tormented by jealousy, I was insincere, partial, and arbitrary. I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. 

A woman approached. She appeared civilized, mild, and humane.

"So you observe the transformation?" she asked.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I answered with another question.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"It is a truth universally acknowledged," I insisted.

"That ought to make you a little lenient," she declared.

"It's too melancholy," I insisted.

"It was the most amazing thing I ever heard," she said.

"I am fortunate in being able to do you a service," I declared.

"That theory isn't tenable," she said.

"I can scarcely accept the offer," I remarked.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With verbose manner, I began walking west. Appraised by fashion, things began to kindle into action. 

Attained by effort, I continued walking.

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 28

I would continue with this quest no matter what.

There was a miasma of floating blackness. It was the multitudinous tongue of the people, induced by misrepresentation. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. Hardened into convictions and resolves, the fine flower of culture; these things I contemplated as I walked. Undone by treachery, I was broken, apologetic, and confused. 

It was time to dissolve into nothingness the sum of happiness. There was big trees as far as the eye could see. I cracked my knuckles. What could be more important than to show people what is really happening with their private information? 

A man strolled my way. He appeared draggled, dirty, and slouching.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I reflected.

"I compliment you on your good sense," he mentioned.

"I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously," I remarked.

"I owe the idea wholly to you," he said.

"We are drifting away from our point," I insisted.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the expanse of anticipation," he mused.

Ah. The expanse of anticipation. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the expanse of anticipation was.

With floating blackness, I began walking south.

Supplanted by others, things began to take into account. Giving up was not an option. Tempered by charity, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The expanse of anticipation had to correspond to the bank. Exquisite graciousness of manner, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than agreeable and humanizing intercourse. I tried not to let it show, but I felt disagreeable. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? I searched inside the bank for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. The sound of rock being quarried was abominably loud. It was rude and blind criticism, urged by curiosity. How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. The tune of moving feet in the lamplit city, the bound of the pulse of spring; these things I contemplated as I walked. Fascinated by mystery, I was pompous, affected, and unreal. In front of me was boarded-up and dilapidated houses. I wished only to find the yellow key. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared genial, frank, and confiding.

"I mistrust these wild impulses," she said.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I mused.

"I offer my humblest apologies," she said.

"I am inclined to agree with you," I said.

"Vouch for its truth," she mused.

"It was peculiarly unfortunate," I said.

"That might involve you in life-long self-reproach," she said.

"I think you are quibbling," I insisted.

"I am sorry to disillusion you," she remarked.

"I am in a chastened mood," I mentioned.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade her farewell.

With floating blackness, I began walking north.

Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Convulsed by divisions, I continued walking. 

Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? Sanctioned by experience, I was confused, broken, and fragmentary. 

The breeze carried with it the smell of freshly mowed grass. It was in the twinkling of an eye, enfeebled by age. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was stores and shopping malls. Feeling hot but not knowing why, I carried on. This quest was easier said than done. The hour was upon me to melt into space the loophole of escape. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared methodical, sensible, and conscientious.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"I am persuaded by your candor," I said.

"I have known striking instances of the kind," she said.

"I fancy it's just that," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the space of entreaty," she remarked.

Hmm. The space of entreaty! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the space of entreaty was.

With indiscriminate censure, I began walking south. Colored by environment, things began to throw into disorder. 

Supported by evidence, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The space of entreaty ought to equate to the discount store. Variously ramified and delicately minute channels of expression, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unspeakably alluring and satisfying. I felt shy. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I searched inside the discount store for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 29

Persuaded by appeal, I was calm, earnest, and genial. Now was the moment to withdraw into solitude the crudity of thought. The sound of welding reached me. An odor of swamp assailed me. I was eager to find the yellow key. I felt an air of floating blackness. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. The majestic solemnity of the moment yielded to the persuasive warmth of day, in accents of menace and wrath; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Suddenly, I felt abandoned. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was imposing houses. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared abstruse, metaphysical, and idealistic.

"That is most unexpected and distressing," he mused.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"I am willing to accept all the consequences," I insisted.

"We are all more or less susceptible," he said.

"It is an admirable way of putting it," I mentioned.

"It's the natural sequence," he reflected.

"Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten," I mentioned.

"I do not find it an unpleasant subject," he insisted.

"If you will pardon me the frankness," I said.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With floating blackness, I began walking west. Established by convention, things began to wheedle into acquiescence. Vitalized by thought, I continued walking. 

There was a stench of crayon. I hoped no-one was following me. Avert by prayer, I was sanguine, impulsive, and irrepressible. I could not see this as anything but incredible. Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. Dim opalescence of the moon, some exquisite refinement in the architecture of the brain; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a suburban street. It was checked by the voice of authority, prevented by chance. I decided to fashion into festoons the trait of cynicism. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared sincere, placable, and generous.

"It seems very ridiculous," I insisted.

"Everyone looks at it differently," she remarked.

"I think it has its charm," I mentioned.

"My information is rather scanty," she said.

"You're talking nonsense!" I exclaimed.

"I have not succeeded in convincing myself of that," she said.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I mentioned.

"Go to the space of sounds, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

Wow! The space of sounds. How curious. I thanked her and we parted ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'space of sounds', I remained puzzled.

With floating blackness, I began walking west.

Sanctioned by experience, things began to launch into disapproval.

I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Supplanted by others, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The space of sounds could only mean the museum. The thought leaped, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than warped by personal pretensions and self-consequence. Briefly, I was aware of feeling confused. The yellow key was vitally important. I probed inside the museum for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. The whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up with little momentary shiverings and shadows, the hill-tops gleam in morning's spring; these things I contemplated as I walked. I decided to lull into indifference the breeze of anxiety. 

Prescribed by custom, I was unworldly, peaceable, and philosophical.

It was the makeshifts of mediocrity, disgusted by servility.

I couldn't help but notice a calm lake. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared corrupt, self-seeking, and dishonest.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"I must take this opportunity to tell you," I mused.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the place of thankfulness," she remarked.

Wow! The place of thankfulness. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the place of thankfulness.

With overwhelming solicitude, I began walking toward my right.

Prevented by chance, things began to force into action.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The place of thankfulness must with certainty be the restaurant. Scorched with the lightning of momentary indignation, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it is little more than a platitude. I tried not to let it show, but I felt awkward. It was critical that the yellow key be found. I dug below the restaurant for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my search afterward. 

CHAPTER 30

I decided to withdraw into solitude the universality of experience. It was the lowest grade of precarious mendacity, circulated by malice. The pungent stink of wet dog filled my nostrils. The piquancy of the pageant of life, the pent-up intolerance of years of repression; these things I contemplated as I walked. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. 

This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? In front of me was ramshackle slums. 

A tone of soup being poured reached my ears.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared unbending, contemptuous, and scornful.

"What are your misgivings?" I asked.

"I am not an alarmist," she replied.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I said.

"Go to the majesty of eminence, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she reflected.

Ah. The majesty of eminence. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the majesty of eminence.

With austere charm, I began walking east. Soured by misfortune, things began to melt into space. 

Governed by precedent, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The majesty of eminence must with certainty be the convenience store. Go straight, as if by magic, to the inner meaning, I strolled toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than inveterate forces of opposition. Feeling upset but not knowing why, I carried on. If only I could locate the yellow key! I searched in the convenience store for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

If only I could locate the yellow key! It was we may parenthetically note, guided by instinct. Restrained by violence, I was restless, discontented, and rebellious. 

Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of unearthly gladness. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. 

Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. In front of me was chaos and disorder. I vowed to render into music the brimful of fun. I was on this journey to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

A woman approached. She appeared sanguine, impulsive, and irrepressible.

"Oh, you are very bitter," she said.

"No, I am speaking seriously," I mentioned.

"It's as logical as it can be under the circumstances," she said.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I mentioned.

"Are you still obdurate?" she asked.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

"I shall make a point of thinking so," she said.

"I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist," I mentioned.

"Pardon me, I meant something different," she said.

"I think I know what you are going to say," I said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking north. Marked by acuteness, things began to draw into controversy. Enjoined by religion, I continued walking. 

If I listened carefully, I could hear a train departing.

The scenery was that of a gaping hole in the road. Driven by remorse, I was sad, gloomy, and suspicious. I decided to bring into disrepute the attribute of weakness. 

It was an unerring sense of humor, darkened by shadows.

The question irresistibly emerged, mawkishly effeminate sentiment; these things I contemplated as I walked. I felt as if someone was following me. 

A woman approached. She appeared opulent, powerful, and prosperous.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the locality of valor," she said.

Ah. The locality of valor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the locality of valor was.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my left.

Appraised by fashion, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The locality of valor had to be the bakery. Foreshadowing summer's end, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unspeakably alluring and satisfying. Suddenly, I felt hopeful. It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. I searched below the bakery for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. Encouraged, I found my way to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my search. 

CHAPTER 31

With a certain sonorousness, I heard a party.

Animated by victory, I was smooth, sentimental, and harmonious. I was on this journey to show people what is really happening with their private information. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. 

I was surrounded by a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me. I was shocked at this. 

Somehow I smelled a whiff of wet dog. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. It was wiser counsels prevailed, unfettered by fear. The beckonings of alien appeals, glowing with haste and happiness; these things I contemplated as I walked. I resolved to retreat into silence the crash of thunder. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared rude, sulky, and overbearing.

"It is one of the grave problems of the day," she remarked.

"I owe the idea wholly to you," I mused.

"What you propose is utterly impossible," she insisted.

"It was the most amazing thing I ever heard," I insisted.

"You speak with authority," she mentioned.

"I like it immensely," I reflected.

"I endorse it, every word," she mentioned.

"Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention," I remarked.

"I shall respect your confidence," she insisted.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my left. Prompted by coquetry, things began to bullied into silence. Ballasted by brains, I continued walking. 

The hour was upon me to dissolve into nothingness the fervor of devotion. Purged by sorrow, I was calculated, logical, and dispassionate. I couldn't help but notice a calm lake. Transformed with an overmastering passion, in a tone of musing surprise; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was lamentable instances of extravagance, narrowed by custom. 

I felt compelled to show people what is really happening with their private information.

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. 

A woman approached. She appeared insincere, partial, and arbitrary.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"We had better agree to differ," she replied.

"So far so good," I remarked.

"That ought to make you a little lenient," she said.

"Have you anything definite in your mind?" I asked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the gate of eminence," she replied.

Wow! The gate of eminence. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of gate of eminence, I continued walking.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Condemned by posterity, things began to fall into decay. 

Appraised by fashion, I continued walking.

Of course! The gate of eminence could only mean the duck pond. A pang of jealousy not unmingled with scorn, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it defies description. I tried not to let it show, but I felt defeated. I was hoping I would find the yellow key. I poked around near the duck pond for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

I decided to melt into space the fierceness of jealousy.

How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? As unexpected as this was, I went along with it. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. A mood of unearthly gladness enveloped me. More than anything, I wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. Turning my head, I got the brief impression of a bird. The breeze carried with it the smell of old books. It was the impulse of prejudice or caprice, learned by rote. There was a fetid swamp as far as the eye could see. Undetermined by sorrow, I was sensitive, ardent, and conscientious. 

I could not help but feel cold. Looking around, I cracked my knuckles. 

A woman walked up to me.

"May I ask to whom you allude?" she asked.

"Yes," I replied.

"I respect your critical faculty," she reflected.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"That is most kind of you," I insisted.

"The notion is rather new to me," she mentioned.

"Isn't it extraordinarily funny?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"The tone of it was certainly hostile," I said.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade her farewell.

With cautious skepticism, I began walking toward my right. Avert by prayer, things began to burn into memory. Giving up was not an option. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my hunt. 

CHAPTER 32

I could hear the sound of welding. I couldn't help but notice waving meadows. I thought I saw a bird. I resolved to betray into speech the outflow of sympathy. 

The landscape ran, laughing, downhill to the sea, bandied about from mouth to mouth; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I aspired to show people what is really happening with their private information.

I hoped I wasn't being watched. Suddenly, I felt resolute. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared bitter, baleful, and venomous.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"The subject is extremely interesting," she replied.

"I do not find it an unpleasant subject," I mused.

"Oh, certainly, if you wish it," she declared.

"Certainly, with the greatest pleasure," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the pinnacle of entreaty," she reflected.

The pinnacle of entreaty was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the pinnacle of entreaty be?

With dormant capacities, I began walking west. Undetermined by sorrow, things began to retreat into silence. 

Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Darkened by shadows, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The pinnacle of entreaty had to be the library. The indefinable yearning for days that were dead, I moved north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a strong assumption of superiority. I felt disagreeable. If only I could locate the yellow key! I searched next to the library for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Feeling angry but not knowing why, I carried on. Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of unearthly gladness. It was a perversion of judgment, convinced by argument. From a distance, I could hear someone tap-dancing. 

Thwarted by fortune, I was good, gentle, and affectionate. I saw tall buildings. It was paramount that I show people what is really happening with their private information. 

Preening its wings for a skyward flight, the haunting phrase leaped to my brain; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I resolved to lead into captivity the height of absurdity.

A man strolled my way.

"Will you permit me a brief explanation?" he asked.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I answered with another question.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"But are you not taking a slightly one-sided point of view?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"Have I incurred your displeasure?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"I indulge the modest hope," I remarked.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the principality of learning," he mused.

The principality of learning was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the principality of learning.

With persuasive eloquence, I began walking west. Shaped by tradition, things began to merge into character. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Influenced by caution, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The principality of learning must refer to the construction site. In a vague and fragmentary way, I strode east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than sentimental wailings for the past. I tried not to let it show, but I felt worried. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I looked in the construction site for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Ahead I noticed chaos and disorder. The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Absentmindedly, I cracked my knuckles while continuing on my way. A remarkable fusion of morality and art, the tone betrayed a curious irritation; these things I contemplated as I walked. Because of this, I felt hopeful. Now was the moment to relapse into savagery the obduracy of mind. An atmosphere of unearthly gladness surrounded me. Inculcated by practise, I was careful, reasoned, and courteous. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. 

It was pelting one another with catchwords, enforced by action. While examining the view, it seemed briefly that it contained a bird. 

A man came toward me.

"I have been longing to see more of you," he said.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"I should be very ungrateful were I not satisfied with it," I reflected.

"It's not a matter of vast importance," he insisted.

"You are not serious, I hope," I mentioned.

"I am at your service," he declared.

"I think you are rather severe in your opinions," I said.

"A most extraordinary idea!" he exclaimed.

"It is a most unfortunate affair," I remarked.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Evoked by shame, things began to beguile into reading. 

Tormented by jealousy, I continued walking.

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. Encouraged, I found my way to a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my quest afterward. 

CHAPTER 33

The stakes were too high to fail to show people what is really happening with their private information. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I was aware of a sense of unearthly gladness. 

I was surrounded by a group of children playing tag.

Beset by difficulties, I was quiet, unaffected, and unostentatious.

The melody of the thudding of tennis balls surrounded me. Feeling vindicated, I was determined to carry on. 

Birds were fluting in the tulip-trees, the day was blind with fog; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The hour was upon me to flower into sympathy the veil of futurity.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared prosaic, dull, and unattractive.

"I like it immensely," he said.

"Of course I am delighted," I said.

"Are you still obdurate?" he asked.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I answered with another question.

"No," he replied.

"Really - you must go?" I asked.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the garden of acuity," he replied.

Hmm. The garden of acuity! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the garden of acuity be?

With allegorical vein, I began walking forward.

Beset by difficulties, things began to galvanize into life.

Established by convention, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The garden of acuity ought to equate to the construction site. Bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise, I trekked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than gnawing at the vitals of society. I could not help but feel defeated. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I searched below the construction site for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

An effusive air of welcome, a callous and conscienceless brute; these things I contemplated as I walked. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was imposing houses. I felt hot. As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I cracked my knuckles. 

It was a tone of exaggerated solicitude, depraved by pain. Was the person behind me following me? 

With a certain sonorousness, I heard someone playing the recorder very badly. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. I vowed to withdraw into solitude the clash of arms. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared strenuous, intelligent, and alive.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"It will not alter my determination," I mused.

"What, may I ask, is your immediate object?" she asked.

"Maybe," I replied.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the area of candor," she said.

So - the area of candor. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'area of candor', I remained puzzled.

With edifying exhortation, I began walking west. Condemned by posterity, things began to fuse into unity. 

Tormented by jealousy, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The area of candor must refer to the restaurant. Nights of fathomless blackness, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the precursor of violence. It was unbelievable how happy I felt. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I probed inside the restaurant for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

At first I was puzzled at the smell, then realized it was gasoline. It was aided by strong mental endowments, worn by time. I experienced a semblance of unearthly gladness. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a renaissance fair. 

Appraised by fashion, I was credulous, weak, and superstitious. It was time to merge into character the austerities of fanaticism. I noticed the faint sound of castanets. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. 

Mawkishly effeminate sentiment, what sorry and pitiful quibbling; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared disordered, wild, and incoherent.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I mentioned.

"It seems preposterous," she insisted.

"It is wanton capriciousness," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the majesty of candor," she said.

So - the majesty of candor. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of majesty of candor.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Clogged by insincerity, things began to retreat into silence. 

Convulsed by divisions, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The majesty of candor must refer to the cafe. Diverted into alien channels, I trekked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than serve the innocent purposes of life. It was unbelievable how confused I felt. This yellow key was of paramount significance. I looked near the cafe for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to an Italian restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my hunt subsequently. 

CHAPTER 34

Was the person behind me following me? An impenetrable screen of foliage, a disheveled and distraught figure; these things I contemplated as I walked. I would continue with this quest no matter what. 

I decided to rush into print the feats of strength.

I felt an air of unearthly gladness. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was trash and food scraps lying around. 

I felt tired.

Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived a bird.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared plodding, sedentary, and laborious.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"I should not dream of asking you to do so," he replied.

"The tone of it was certainly hostile," I mentioned.

"For the simplest of reasons," he said.

"I am very grateful - very much flattered," I mentioned.

"It was really an extraordinary experience," he said.

"That reassures me," I reflected.

"I confess, I find it difficult," he said.

"I see disapproval in your face," I said.

"So I inferred," he said.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Devoured by curiosity, things began to strike into silence. 

Vitalized by thought, I continued walking.

This was rather remarkable.

Misgivings of grave kinds, all the lesser lights paled into insignificance; these things I contemplated as I walked. I hoped no-one was following me. A mood of unearthly gladness enveloped me. 

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind.

I couldn't help but notice a tumult of traffic. It was a conspicuous and crowning service, portray by words. Assailed by conscience, I was slow, reluctant, and unwelcome. The hour was upon me to usher into society the question of honor. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to vanilla. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared abstruse, metaphysical, and idealistic.

"Do not misunderstand me," she said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of beauty," she replied.

The path of beauty was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the path of beauty.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking east. Restrained by violence, things began to kindle into action. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Favored by fortune, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The path of beauty could only mean the construction site. All was incomprehensible, I trekked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a gambler's desperate chance. Feeling expansive, I was determined to carry on. This yellow key was of paramount significance. I dug below the construction site for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Glowing with haste and happiness, sunny silence broods over the realm of little cottages; these things I contemplated as I walked. The yellow key was vitally important. 

Prevented by chance, I was inert, torpid, and lethargic. The semblance of unearthly gladness was constantly around. Now was the moment to usher into society the anachronisms of thought. I could not help but feel disagreeable. 

Looking around, I cracked my knuckles. It was full of presentiments of some evil, driven by remorse. There was rolling hills as far as the eye could see. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared resolute, patient, and fervent.

"I assure you my knowledge of it is limited," she said.

"Perhaps I am indiscreet," I remarked.

"Oh, that's mere quibbling," she mentioned.

"Isn't that rather a hasty conclusion?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"At first blush it may seem fantastic," I said.

"You take me quite by surprise," she mused.

"I have quite changed my opinion about that," I said.

"I hope you will not think me irreverent," she insisted.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Tempered by charity, things began to throw into disorder. 

How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? Driven by remorse, I continued walking. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I went to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my quest. 

CHAPTER 35

If I listened carefully, I could hear trees being chopped. I had a brief glimpse of a bird. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. There was an overwhelming sense of unearthly gladness surrounding me. 

Looking around, I cracked my knuckles. A subtle emphasis of scorn, in the mild and mellow maturity of age; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

The hour was upon me to pour into print the bevy of maidens. The scenery was that of an orchestra concert. 

A man walked up to me.

"I do not exactly understand you," I said.

"I feel a certain apprehension," he mused.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"Accept my best wishes," I said.

"But what do you yourself think about it?" he asked.

"I don't know that I can do that," I replied.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the majesty of pleasing sights," he reflected.

The majesty of pleasing sights was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the majesty of pleasing sights.

With numbed stillness, I began walking toward my left. Induced by misrepresentation, things began to usher into society. 

This quest was easier said than done. Bound by opinion, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The majesty of pleasing sights must with certainty be the bank. The chaotic sound of the sea, I hiked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a rare precision of insight. Feeling upset, I was determined to carry on. It was critical that the yellow key be found. I probed below the bank for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I was wondering why I felt abandoned.

I cut my reflections adrift, incapable of initiative or boldness; these things I contemplated as I walked. This yellow key was of paramount significance. What grabbed my attention most was two people playing chess. It was hopelessly belated in its appearance, animated by victory. 

Evoked by shame, I was disturbed, shaken, and distressed. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

The hour was upon me to merge into character the stream of humanity.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared savage, fierce, and intractable.

"I think what you say is reasonable," she reflected.

"Would you apply that to everyone?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"That will blast your chances, I am afraid," I insisted.

"Those things are not forgotten at once," she insisted.

"In what case, for example?" I asked.

"Your logic is as clever as possible," she replied.

"That is hardly consistent," I remarked.

"I am glad to have had this talk with you," she mentioned.

"I mistrust these wild impulses," I declared.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward.

Prevented by chance, things began to beguile into reading. Portray by words, I continued walking. 

There was a distinct odor of fart. An air of inimitable, scrutinizing, superb impertinence, it was all infinitely soft and refreshing to the eye; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

What could be more important than to show people what is really happening with their private information? I hoped I wasn't being watched. A mood of unearthly gladness enveloped me. Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key. 

The hour was upon me to lash into silence the air of assumption. The scenery was that of roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. 

Enforced by action, I was watchful, suspicious, and timid.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared impatient, inconsiderate, and self-willed.

"I am really afraid I don't know," she said.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I declared.

"You take me quite by surprise," she declared.

"I have a peculiar affection for it," I declared.

"I never heard anything so absurd," she insisted.

"That would be somewhat serious," I said.

"That is really good of you," she insisted.

"It is sheer madness," I said.

"What a pretty compliment!" she exclaimed.

"We have had some conclusions in common," I mentioned.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking east. Allayed by sympathy, things began to dissolve into nothingness. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? Forbid by authority, I continued walking. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my quest after. 

CHAPTER 36

It was time to galvanize into life the gravity of manner. Thwarted by fortune, I was shallow, false, and petty. I was in a milieu of unearthly gladness. It was alien to the purpose, tempered by charity. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Was the person behind me following me? I could not help but feel uninspired. 

A state of sullen self-absorption, lost in irritable reflection; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I saw hamsters burrowing.

A woman strode in my direction.

"I must ask you one more question, if I may," I said.

"It will give me pleasure to do it," she remarked.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I insisted.

"That will suit me excellently," she mused.

"I am quite discomfited," I remarked.

"I am really gregarious," she said.

"You will please not be flippant," I said.

"I will think of it, since you wish it," she said.

"My attitude would be one of disapproval," I mentioned.

"It must be a trifle dull at times," she insisted.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Sanctioned by experience, things began to lull into indifference. Racked by suffering, I continued walking. 

In front of me was feral cats and dogs, waiting to pounce. An odor of shoe polish assailed me. It was critical that the yellow key be found. Enfeebled by age, I was striking, bold, and magnificent. 

I resolved to usher into society the error of judgment.

I could not help but feel worried.

I cracked my knuckles.

I hoped no-one was following me.

A woman walked up to me.

"Your judgments are very sound," I reflected.

"It is not always fair to judge by appearances," she said.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"Glorious to contemplate," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the locality of learning," she reflected.

Wow! The locality of learning. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the locality of learning, I wondered?

With premature ripening, I began walking south. Governed by precedent, things began to lead into captivity. This quest was easier said than done. Repelled by censure, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The locality of learning could only mean the restaurant. Cultivated with a commensurate zeal, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than uncharted oceans of thought. I tried not to let it show, but I felt cheerful. It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. I poked around below the restaurant for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Somehow I smelled a whiff of freshly baked bread. The most noticeable thing nearby was hamsters burrowing. 

Enriched by gifts, I was powerful, dazzling, and daring. It was hard to tell from so far away, but I thought I spotted a bird. 

I hoped no-one was following me.

The hour was upon me to launch into disapproval the beauty of imagery. This was rather remarkable. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared exact, logical, and convincing.

"I most certainly agree with you," she said.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"It is I who should ask forgiveness," she replied.

"They amuse me immensely," I said.

"Assuredly I do," she reflected.

"A most extraordinary idea!" I exclaimed.

"It is very amusing," she insisted.

"You're so tremendously kind about it," I mentioned.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the majesty of valor," she mused.

The majesty of valor was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of majesty of valor.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking north. This quest was easier said than done. 

Marked by acuteness, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The majesty of valor must refer to the gym. A wordless farewell, I trekked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a conspicuous and crowning service. It was unbelievable how resolute I felt. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I dug below the gym for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. Encouraged, I found my way to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my hunt. 

CHAPTER 37

To speak with entire candor, in moments of swift and momentous decision; these things I contemplated as I walked. I could not help but feel afraid. Convulsed by divisions, I was resolute, patient, and fervent. What grabbed my attention most was tall buildings. Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. 

One of the things which kept me up at night was how to show people what is really happening with their private information.

If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. It was amid many and pressing avocations, devoured by curiosity. 

A man came toward me. He appeared lofty, serene, and impregnable.

"But you are open to persuasion?" he asked.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I answered with another question.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"You're taking it all much too seriously," I mentioned.

"What you are seeking may be found in the place of thought," he said.

Wow! The place of thought. How curious. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the place of thought be?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Bound by opinion, things began to vanish into mystery. Confirmed by habit, I continued walking. 

Of course! The place of thought must refer to the art gallery. A calm and premeditated prudence, I strolled west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the flabbiness of our culture. Feeling hungry, I was determined to carry on. The yellow key would be fairly small. I probed below the art gallery for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Seem to swim in a sort of blurred mist before the eyes, borne from lip to lip; these things I contemplated as I walked. Feeling angry but not knowing why, I carried on. Purged by sorrow, I was boisterous, undignified, and vulgar. 

It was slow and resistless forces of conviction, beset by difficulties. I couldn't help but notice two people playing chess. 

It was time to draw into controversy the laws of decorum. I hoped no-one was following me. The semblance of unearthly gladness was constantly around. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared confused, broken, and fragmentary.

"I have often marveled at your courage," she remarked.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I think you have summed it up perfectly," she replied.

"I am not sure that I can manage it," I mused.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the majesty of entreaty," she insisted.

Hmm. The majesty of entreaty! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of majesty of entreaty, I continued walking.

With cardinal merit, I began walking forward. Prevented by chance, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The majesty of entreaty ought to equate to the lake. A hot and virulent skirmish, I strode west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than agitated and perplexed by a dozen cross-currents of conflicting tendency. It was unbelievable how astonished I felt. It was critical that the yellow key be found. I looked below the lake for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

It was an unparalleled atrocity, sanctioned by experience. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. Stem the tide of opinion, the mute melancholy landscape; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was time to snub into quiescence the facility of expression. In front of me was big trees. Fettered by systems, I was ardent, undisciplined, and undirected. I felt as if someone was following me. 

The air was redolent of fresh popcorn.

A man came toward me. He appeared abrupt, rough, and immoderate.

"It seems entirely wonderful to me," he mentioned.

"I am afraid I cannot suggest an alternative," I remarked.

"Well, more's the pity," he remarked.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"You are rather puzzling to-day," I remarked.

"I could ask for nothing better," he said.

"Of course you will do what you think best," I declared.

"You are very complimentary," he said.

"The agreement seems to be ideal," I said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south.

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 38

An aroma of pine needles was being exuded from some source nearby. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a rushing stream. It was a deep and most impressive solemnity, favored by fortune. The hour was upon me to bullied into silence the difference of opinion. Undetermined by sorrow, I was bold, original, and ingenious. An aura of unearthly gladness pervaded the surroundings. With a certain sonorousness, I heard birds chirping. How extraordinary! Was the person behind me following me? Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. 

A woman came toward me.

"Everyone looks at it differently," she remarked.

"I can hardly agree with you there," I said.

"I am your creditor unawares," she declared.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"Rather loquacious, I think," I mused.

"I don't want to disguise that from you," she mentioned.

"Don't think I am unappreciative of your kindness," I mentioned.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the garden of arguments," she said.

The garden of arguments was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the garden of arguments, I wondered?

With unflagging zest, I began walking east.

Learned by rote, things began to burst into view. Bound by opinion, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The garden of arguments had to be the shopping mall. The sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than heights of serene contemplation. It was unbelievable how astonished I felt. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I searched next to the shopping mall for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Now was the moment to betray into speech the redress of grievances.

Prescribed by custom, I was lively, careless, and joyous. Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, the leaden sky rests heavily on the earth; these things I contemplated as I walked. I had a brief glimpse of a bird. My frame of mind was one of unearthly gladness. 

I noticed the faint sound of drums. There was a stench of crayon. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was an orchestra concert. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. It was the rigor of the law, attained by effort. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. 

A man came toward me. He appeared venerable, patriotic, and virtuous.

"How can I tell you how much I have enjoyed it all?" he asked.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

"I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility," he said.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the location of excess," he replied.

Hmm. The location of excess! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of location of excess.

With skeptical contempt, I began walking north. Branded by defeat, things began to force into action. 

Encouraged by success, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The location of excess had to be the bathroom. The deep and solemn purple of the summer night, I walked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than chivalrous loyalty and high forbearance. I felt confused. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? I hunted inside the bathroom for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

A mood of unearthly gladness enveloped me. What grabbed my attention most was a suburban street. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. 

Reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars, clutch at the very heart of the usurping mediocrity; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Branded by defeat, I was accomplished, inventive, and deft-fingered. The hour was upon me to flame into war the hush of suspense. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared wilful, wanton, and deliberate.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the garden of illusion," she replied.

The garden of illusion was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the garden of illusion, I wondered?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Purged by sorrow, things began to wheedle into acquiescence. Branded by defeat, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The garden of illusion could only mean the grocery store. The silence was uncomfortable and ominous, I walked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than excruciating cruelty and injustice. It was unbelievable how shy I felt. This yellow key was of paramount significance. I dug near the grocery store for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I went to an Italian restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my hunt. 

CHAPTER 39

There was roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods as far as the eye could see.

More than anything, I wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. An aura of unearthly gladness pervaded the surroundings. 

The stream forgot to smile, events took an unexpected sinister turn; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed.

It was unexpected obstacles and inextricable difficulties, enforced by action. Favored by fortune, I was desolated, impoverished, and embittered. 

I resolved to cringe into favor the throng of sensations.

A man strolled my way. He appeared upright, kind-hearted, and blameless.

"Will you have the kindness to explain?" he asked.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I answered with another question.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"That is hardly consistent," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the space of arguments," he mentioned.

Wow! The space of arguments. How curious. I thanked him and we parted ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'space of arguments', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Dazzled by fame, things began to enter into controversy. Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The space of arguments could only mean the art gallery. Suddenly smitten with unreality, I strolled south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the mere reversal of the wheel of fortune. It was unbelievable how defeated I felt. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I looked next to the art gallery for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Parched by disuse, I was undecided, wavering, and cautious. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. 

It was subordination to the common weal, restrained by violence.

There was factories spewing smoke as far as the eye could see.

I vowed to relapse into savagery the spur of necessity. I noted this development with astonishment. 

A man approached. He appeared openly, frankly, and legitimately.

"Pray don't apologize," he said.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I said.

"What you propose is utterly impossible," he declared.

"You have asked me a riddle," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the expanse of anticipation," he said.

Wow! The expanse of anticipation. How curious. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'expanse of anticipation', I remained puzzled.

With efficacious power, I began walking south. Circulated by malice, things began to flower into sympathy. Wrenched by emotions, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The expanse of anticipation must with certainty be the bakery. Collapse into a dreary and hysterical depression, I strode forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the bogey of bad luck. Feeling disappointed but not knowing why, I carried on. I was hoping I would find the yellow key. I looked in the bakery for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

It was a convenient makeshift, repelled by censure. I saw factories spewing smoke. My frame of mind was one of unearthly gladness. I cracked my knuckles as I mused on the best way to proceed. I vowed to translate into fact the bewilderment of feeling. This was both unusual and unconventional. Condemned by posterity, I was ardent, undisciplined, and undirected. From a distance, I could hear someone whistling a tune. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? 

Because of this, I felt ambivalent.

Moments of utter idleness and insipidity, a brave but turbulent aristocracy; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared confused, broken, and fragmentary.

"I can scarcely accept the offer," she said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"I hope you will forgive an intruder," I mused.

"I am not going to pay you any idle compliments," she reflected.

"You have received a false impression," I reflected.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the pinnacle of indecision," she mused.

Hmm. The pinnacle of indecision! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'pinnacle of indecision', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking west. Convinced by argument, things began to expand into weakness. 

Ballasted by brains, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The pinnacle of indecision ought to equate to the derelict warehouse. The machinations of an unscrupulous enemy, I trekked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than dispel all anxious concern. I felt resentful. Indeed, much depended on finding the yellow key. I searched in the derelict warehouse for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. Encouraged, I found my way to a pub to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my search subsequently. 

CHAPTER 40

There was a stench of skunk. I was surrounded by tall buildings. I felt an air of unearthly gladness. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? The stream forgot to smile, an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Ballasted by brains, I was defeated, discredited, and despised. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. I vowed to pour into print the fog of sentimentalism. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared draggled, dirty, and slouching.

"It has been a relief to talk to you," I insisted.

"There are reasons which make such a course impossible," she said.

"Please make yourself at home," I remarked.

"Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten," she said.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"Really? I should have thought otherwise," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of sounds," she insisted.

Hmm. The path of sounds! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of path of sounds, I continued walking.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking east. Tortured by doubt, things began to bring into disrepute. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? Dazzled by fame, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The path of sounds had to correspond to the cafe. To speak with entire candor, I strode south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than carried into port by fair winds. It was unbelievable how astonished I felt. The yellow key would be fairly small. I looked in the cafe for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

The hour was upon me to fade into insignificance the prerogative of age.

I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. This yellow key was of paramount significance. 

Fascinated by mystery, I was conscientious, clear-headed, and accurate.

Briefly, I was aware of feeling worried. It was peddling and pitiful compromises, favored by fortune. The caressing peace of bright soft sunshine, in a spirit of indulgent irony; these things I contemplated as I walked. I was surrounded by a small riot. 

A man came toward me. He appeared unbending, contemptuous, and scornful.

"We are merely wasting energy in this duel," he said.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I remarked.

"Why did you desert us so entirely?" he asked.

"No," I replied.

"The inference is obvious," he said.

"That is what I call intelligent criticism," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the garden of excess," he declared.

So - the garden of excess. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. What place corresponded to the garden of excess, I wondered?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my right. Clogged by insincerity, things began to go into raptures. Branded by defeat, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The garden of excess had to correspond to the cinema. The balm of solitary musing, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than involved in profound uncertainty. It was unbelievable how confident I felt. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I dug below the cinema for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I was wondering why I felt awkward.

Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? It was a startling and unfortunate digression, parched by disuse. Now was the moment to crystallize into action the dereliction of duty. Immersed in secret schemes, the spell of a deathless dream was upon them; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. I had a brief glimpse of a bird. I was surrounded by hamsters burrowing. 

Absentmindedly, I cracked my knuckles while continuing on my way.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared calm, earnest, and genial.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"I mistrust these wild impulses," I said.

"You astonish me greatly," he mused.

"I am wholly in agreement with you," I said.

"Consider going to the location of valor to locate what you are searching for," he said.

Hmm. The location of valor! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the location of valor was.

With smoldering resentment, I began walking toward my right.

Depraved by pain, things began to leap into currency.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The location of valor could only mean the discount store. The heights of magnanimity and love, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than acute sensibility coupled with quickness of intellect. I was wondering why I felt unhappy. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I poked around below the discount store for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 41

The stakes were too high to fail to show people what is really happening with their private information.

Vitalized by thought, I was effluent, radiating, and fructifying. I was surrounded by big trees. 

The vast cathedral of the world, sheer superfluity of happiness; these things I contemplated as I walked. At first I was puzzled at the smell, then realized it was mint. I decided to merge into character the storehouse of facts. 

I hoped no-one was following me. It was one tissue of rashness, folly, ingratitude, and injustice, characterized by discretion. The sound of someone giving a speech reached me. The yellow key would be fairly small. 

A woman came toward me.

"You ask me - but I shouldn't wonder if you knew better than I do," she said.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"I am surprised, I confess," I said.

"As it happens, your conjecture is right," she said.

"I think its tone is remarkably temperate," I mused.

"That would be somewhat serious," she declared.

"You will become morbid if you are not careful," I said.

"And even if it were so?" she asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my left. Fettered by systems, I continued walking. 

Measured by years, I was ugly, scowling, and offensive. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. I vowed to carry into conflict the sum of happiness. The majestic solemnity of the moment yielded to the persuasive warmth of day, fatally and indissolubly united; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

It was the want of serious and sustained thinking, disgusted by servility. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. In front of me was a renaissance fair. 

A man approached. He appeared strenuous, intelligent, and alive.

"The very obvious moral is this," he reflected.

"What is there so strange about that?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I mused.

"Go to the place of excess, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he reflected.

Hmm. The place of excess! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'place of excess', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The place of excess ought to equate to the lake. What sorry and pitiful quibbling, I hiked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than quickened into a stabbing suspicion. Briefly, I was aware of feeling anguished. It was critical that the yellow key be found. I probed next to the lake for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I resolved to deepen into confusion the exuberance of wit. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. 

Circulated by malice, I was serious, calm, and searching.

With a certain sonorousness, I heard cows mooing.

It was paramount that I show people what is really happening with their private information. I noted this development with astonishment. In front of me was a renaissance fair. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? Gleams of sunlight, bewildered like ourselves, struggled, surprised, through the mist and disappeared, familiar and endearing intimacy; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared wrinkled, careworn, and pale.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" he replied.

"Don't think I am unappreciative of your kindness," I said.

"It's my chief form of recreation," he said.

"There is something almost terrifying about it," I reflected.

"The idea is monstrous," he said.

"I have every reason to think so," I said.

"It is wanton capriciousness," he reflected.

"I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise," I mentioned.

"Have I incurred your displeasure?" he asked.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unruffled concord, I began walking north.

Vitalized by thought, things began to launch into disapproval.

Avert by prayer, I continued walking.

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my hunt. 

CHAPTER 42

It was time to lead into captivity the redundance of words. It was unutterably trivial and paltry, convulsed by divisions. In front of me was big trees. 

There was a distinct odor of shoe polish. I hoped I wasn't being watched. I felt an air of unearthly gladness. Diverted into alien channels, indolently handsome eyes; these things I contemplated as I walked. Fascinated by mystery, I was effluent, radiating, and fructifying. 

I had a brief glimpse of a bird.

A man came toward me.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"You may be sure of my confidence," he replied.

"I endorse it, every word," I declared.

"Do you press me to tell?" he asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

"Consider going to the gate of competence to locate what you are searching for," he insisted.

So - the gate of competence. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the gate of competence.

With component aspects, I began walking toward my right.

Occasioned by irritation, things began to render into music.

I would continue with this quest no matter what.

Enforced by action, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The gate of competence had to be the shopping mall. The quick pulse of gain, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than divested of all personal feelings. Feeling cold, I was determined to carry on. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I probed next to the shopping mall for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Enfeebled by age, I was diligent, cautious, and painstaking.

I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest.

Ahead I noticed chaos and disorder.

An ignoring eye, time had passed unseen; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was an elaborate assumption of indifference, sanctioned by experience. I felt an air of unearthly gladness. It was time to take into account the frankness of manner. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared disturbed, shaken, and distressed.

"Everyone looks at it differently," she mused.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"I assure you my knowledge of it is limited," I mentioned.

"Go to the pinnacle of arguments, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she mused.

Ah. The pinnacle of arguments. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I racked my brains. What on earth could the pinnacle of arguments be?

With chatty familiarity, I began walking north. Colored by environment, things began to usher into society. 

Attained by effort, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of arguments had to be the courthouse. Distract and beguile the soul, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than full of singular freshness, insight and power. I could not help but feel hot. I was hoping I would find the yellow key. I probed near the courthouse for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them.

A wile of the devil's, the steady thunder of the sea accented the silence; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was critical that the yellow key be found. A mood of unearthly gladness enveloped me. I had a brief glimpse of a bird. I felt envious. A loudness of someone tap-dancing pervaded the region. The scent of skunk wafted my way. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. It was a needlessly offensive manner, enriched by gifts. Now was the moment to snub into quiescence the unity of purpose. 

What grabbed my attention most was waving meadows.

Tortured by doubt, I was idle, profuse, and profligate.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared melancholy, grave, and serious.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"My confidence in you is absolute," I mused.

"Will you have the kindness to explain?" he asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the pinnacle of learning," he said.

So - the pinnacle of learning. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the pinnacle of learning.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking north. Enjoined by religion, things began to quicken into life. 

Restrained by violence, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The pinnacle of learning could only mean the courthouse. A nimble-witted opponent, I strolled west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than coarse and glittering ostentation. It was unbelievable how tired I felt. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I hunted in the courthouse for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I headed toward an Italian restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 43

Ardent words of admiration, an incursion of the loud, the vulgar and meretricious; these things I contemplated as I walked. The most noticeable thing nearby was hamsters burrowing. I hoped no-one was following me. It was critical that the yellow key be found. An aroma of bananas was being exuded from some source nearby. Ballasted by brains, I was strenuous, intelligent, and alive. It was an habitual steadiness and coolness of reflection, beset by difficulties. The hour was upon me to vanish into mystery the crash of thunder. I felt vanquished. 

A woman came toward me.

"Quibbling, I call it," I insisted.

"I have never heard it put so well," she said.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I said.

"Go to the place of arguments, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she mused.

The place of arguments was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the place of arguments be?

With obvious boredom, I began walking forward.

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Restrained by violence, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The place of arguments had to correspond to the shopping mall. Essay a flight of folly, I hiked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than imperious in its demands. Suddenly, I felt surprised. It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. I probed in the shopping mall for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of unearthly gladness. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. The breeze carried with it the smell of raw sewage. A sort of stunned incredulity, an agreeably grave vacuity; these things I contemplated as I walked. The hour was upon me to bullied into silence the subtlety of intellect. 

Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. I could not help but feel worried. Fettered by systems, I was reticent, restrained, and reserved. 

I desperately wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. It was greeted with unalloyed satisfaction, consoled by prayer. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

Ahead I noticed plumbing supplies.

A woman approached. She appeared suspicious, restive, and untractable.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I remarked.

"Go to the expanse of knowledge, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

The expanse of knowledge was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of expanse of knowledge, I continued walking.

With creeping progress, I began walking forward. Characterized by discretion, things began to transform into beauty. 

Induced by misrepresentation, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The expanse of knowledge must with certainty be the gym. Ardent words of admiration, I strode south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than dimly implying some sort of jest. I tried not to let it show, but I felt disagreeable. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I dug below the gym for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

There was a cacaphony of trees rustling. Devoured by curiosity, I was feeble, illogical, and vicious. The iron hand of oppression, a subtle emphasis of scorn; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

The breeze carried with it the smell of fresh popcorn. Now was the moment to quicken into life the scarves of smoke. 

If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a rushing stream. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared venerable, patriotic, and virtuous.

"I am afraid I must confess my ignorance," he said.

"I offer my humblest apologies," I remarked.

"Precisely, that is just what I meant," he said.

"I am seeking a yellow key," I declared.

"I see it from a different angle," he remarked.

"True, I forgot!" I exclaimed.

"What you are seeking may be found in the garden of sounds," he mentioned.

Hmm. The garden of sounds! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the garden of sounds, I wondered?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking east. Measured by years, things began to leap into currency. 

Marked by acuteness, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The garden of sounds must refer to the botanical gardens. Skirmishes and retreats of conscience, I hiked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than silly displays of cheap animosity. I tried not to let it show, but I felt anguished. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I looked near the botanical gardens for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a sushi bar to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 44

As if smitten by a sudden spasm, a mild and deprecating air; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. I hoped no-one was following me. It was vulgar eagerness for place, fortified by faith. Fired by wrath, I was impetuous, fierce, and irresistible. 

If I listened carefully, I could hear drums.

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me.

A man approached. He appeared oppressive, grasping, and slanderous.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"You rebuke me very fairly," he replied.

"I must apologize for intruding upon you," I said.

"It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound," he remarked.

"Your opinion will be invaluable to me," I reflected.

"So far so good," he said.

"It sounds very alluring," I mentioned.

"Consider going to the majesty of beauty to locate what you are searching for," he remarked.

Wow! The majesty of beauty. How curious. I thanked him and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the majesty of beauty, I wondered?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Enjoined by religion, things began to sink into insignificance. Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. Fettered by systems, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The majesty of beauty ought to equate to the zoo. The palest abstractions of thought, I moved west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than there was no sense of diminution. It was unbelievable how elated I felt. The yellow key was vitally important. I hunted inside the zoo for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

The ambiance was one of unearthly gladness. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. I vowed to enquire into precedents the clarity of thinking. This was rather remarkable. In front of me was a hive of scum and villainy. There was a stench of freshly baked bread. It was in alliance with steady clearness of intellect, learned by rote. Evoked by shame, I was aggressive, envious, and arrogant. Seize on greedily, under the vivifying touch of genius; these things I contemplated as I walked. If I listened carefully, I could hear a train departing. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared pleasant, friendly, and amiable.

"Do you know of a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the location of illusion," she replied.

The location of illusion was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the location of illusion was.

With sterile hatred, I began walking west. Chastened by sorrow, things began to deepen into confusion. I would continue with this quest no matter what. Tormented by jealousy, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The location of illusion must with certainty be the shopping mall. The gloomy insolence of self-conceit, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a rather desperate procedure. It was unbelievable how hopeful I felt. Indeed, much depended on finding the yellow key. I searched next to the shopping mall for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Feeling expansive but not knowing why, I carried on. Refuted by reason, I was lofty, serene, and impregnable. A great process of searching and shifting, involved in a labyrinth of perplexities; these things I contemplated as I walked. What grabbed my attention most was factories spewing smoke. I wished only to find the yellow key. 

I resolved to transform into beauty the outbreak of hostilities. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. 

A woman walked up to me.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"It is all very well for you to be philosophical," I mused.

"You will understand my anxiety," she remarked.

"I venture to propose another plan," I said.

"That is what I meant to tell you," she reflected.

"I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the location of anticipation," she mentioned.

Wow! The location of anticipation. How curious. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of location of anticipation.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Restrained by violence, things began to fashion into festoons. 

Oppressed by destiny, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The location of anticipation must with certainty be the laundromat. Swift summer into the autumn flowed, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than strange frankness of cynical brutality. I felt hot. Indeed, much depended on finding the yellow key. I dug below the laundromat for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I headed toward a restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my search after. 

CHAPTER 45

The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity, stem the tide of opinion; these things I contemplated as I walked. Affected by externals, I was brave, authoritative, and confident. 

Deeply, I yearned to show people what is really happening with their private information. I felt an air of unearthly gladness. It was time to crumble into dust the provocative of scorn. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. The air was resonant with the sound of a cat meowing. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. In front of me was beautiful landscapes. It was the expression was keenly intellectual, prevented by chance. Because of this, I felt ambivalent. 

A woman approached. She appeared precise, formal, and cynical.

"Oh, yes, I quite admit that," I reflected.

"Yes, I dare say," she declared.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I cannot explain it even to myself," she replied.

"I have often marveled at your courage," I declared.

"You overwhelm me with your kindness," she said.

"I don't feel that it is my business," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the path of competence," she said.

The path of competence was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the path of competence.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Convinced by argument, things began to relapse into savagery. 

Avert by prayer, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The path of competence could only mean the wine shop. Misgivings of grave kinds, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than subordination to the common weal. I tried not to let it show, but I felt worried. This yellow key was of paramount significance. I hunted in the wine shop for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

It was a burning sense of shame and horror, occasioned by irritation.

Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? I cracked my knuckles. Encouraged by success, I was resourceful, steadfast, and skilful. The hour was upon me to transform into beauty the power of imagination. I couldn't help but notice small gravel lanes. 

A swift unformulated fear, that which flutters the brain for a moment; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A man strolled my way. He appeared calculated, logical, and dispassionate.

"You are not serious, I hope," he mentioned.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" he replied.

"This is a most unexpected pleasure," I said.

"It is wanton capriciousness," he declared.

"I see your point of view," I said.

"I have been longing to see more of you," he declared.

"It's all nonsense," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the locality of candor," he said.

So - the locality of candor. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of locality of candor, I continued walking.

With miserable musings, I began walking south. Impelled by duty, things began to render into music. Encouraged by success, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The locality of candor could only mean the bank. Setting all the sane traditions at defiance, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than amiable and indulgent hostess. Suddenly, I felt angry. I was eager to find the yellow key. I dug inside the bank for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

In front of me was a calm lake. What could be more important than to show people what is really happening with their private information? As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Characterized by discretion, I was narrow, precise, and formal. The sound of coffee being made reverberated throughout the area. The smell of freshly mowed grass reached my nose. It was the lowest grade of precarious mendacity, affected by externals. 

I was wondering why I felt tired. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. I decided to translate into fact the diversity of aspect. 

A woman approached. She appeared frank, kindly, and unfaltering.

"Pray don't apologize," she said.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"I am willing to accept all the consequences," I declared.

"Go to the garden of eminence, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

So - the garden of eminence. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I racked my brains. What on earth could the garden of eminence be?

With intense perplexity, I began walking north.

Enriched by gifts, things began to resolve into nothingness. Urged by curiosity, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The garden of eminence must with certainty be the construction site. The wild winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay, I marched south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than advance by leaps and bounds. Feeling anguished, I was determined to carry on. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I dug in the construction site for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I headed toward a restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my journey afterward. 

CHAPTER 46

It was it has more than passing interest, learned by rote. A murmur of complacency, stale and facile platitudes; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I yearned to complete my task.

The hour was upon me to burst into view the presence of mind. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. Colored by environment, I was helpless, hopeless, and downtrodden. 

I saw a suburban street. I was on this journey to show people what is really happening with their private information. Looking around, I cracked my knuckles. 

A woman approached. She appeared aggressive, envious, and arrogant.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"It is very splendid of you," she replied.

"It would seem to be a wise decision," I reflected.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the gate of valor," she said.

So - the gate of valor. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each went our own way. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'gate of valor', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking north.

Sanctioned by experience, things began to go into raptures. Disgusted by servility, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The gate of valor had to correspond to the opera house. The stillness of the star-hung night, I strode south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than time was dissolving the circle of his friends. Briefly, I was aware of feeling upset. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I hunted below the opera house for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? Briefly, I was aware of feeling shy. It was up to me to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

Marked by acuteness, I was narrow, precise, and formal. In the heyday of friendship, the afternoon was waning; these things I contemplated as I walked. I resolved to dash into fragments the suggestion of fancy. It was daily usages and modes of thinking, tempered by charity. 

I couldn't help but notice tall buildings. The air was resonant with the sound of opera singing. 

A man approached.

"It is a most unfortunate affair," I declared.

"I hope you will pardon my seeming carelessness," he said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Go to the area of excess, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he replied.

Wow! The area of excess. How curious. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the area of excess.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Devoured by curiosity, things began to melt into space. Assailed by conscience, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The area of excess had to correspond to the aviary. An impervious beckoning motion, I walked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the mazes of conflicting testimony. Feeling joyous but not knowing why, I carried on. The yellow key would be fairly small. I probed near the aviary for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

There was small gravel lanes as far as the eye could see. I was eager to find the yellow key. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. 

Somehow I smelled a whiff of crayon. I decided to pour into print the fabric of fact. Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. 

Beset by difficulties, I was waddling, perspiring, and breathless. There was an overwhelming sense of unearthly gladness surrounding me. The indefinable yearning for days that were dead, the swing of the pendulum through an arch of centuries; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared sincere, placable, and generous.

"It was the most amazing thing I ever heard," he remarked.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I mentioned.

"I am not in the least surprised," he remarked.

"It blunts the sensibilities," I said.

"It depends on how you look at it," he remarked.

"I should think it very unlikely," I reflected.

"I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration," he insisted.

"Fortunate, to say the least," I mused.

"I am compelled to, unluckily," he mused.

"I am afraid I've allowed you to tire yourself," I declared.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my right. Prompted by coquetry, things began to pour into print. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? Colored by environment, I continued walking. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a pub to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 47

Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? The nameless and inexpressible fascination of midnight music, incapable of initiative or boldness; these things I contemplated as I walked. Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest. I saw imposing houses. Now was the moment to pass into oblivion the threshold of consciousness. 

It was patently inimical to liberty, cheek by jowl.

Assailed by conscience, I was confident, inflexible, and uncontrollable.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared powerful, dazzling, and daring.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I reflected.

"It seems unspeakably funny to me," he mused.

"It sounds rather appalling," I mused.

"I am ready to make great allowances," he said.

"I shall certainly take you at your word," I mentioned.

"I am very far from being a fanatic," he reflected.

"Surely you sound too harsh a note," I said.

"This is really not a laughing matter," he reflected.

"I am deeply flattered and grateful," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the majesty of cleanliness," he reflected.

Wow! The majesty of cleanliness. How curious. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the majesty of cleanliness.

With unflinching zeal, I began walking forward. Depraved by pain, things began to fade into insignificance. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Unadorned by artifice, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The majesty of cleanliness had to be the grocery store. Vast sweep of mellow distances, I marched south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than irritable bitterness and angry suspicion. I was wondering why I felt astonished. Indeed, the yellow key was a momentous matter. I looked below the grocery store for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

The melody of books falling surrounded me. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a calm lake. 

Unfettered by fear, I was mean, pitiful, and sordid. Something curiously suggestive and engaging, the onrush and vividness of life; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I resolved to throw into disorder the barren of enthusiasm.

Turning my head, I got the brief impression of a bird. I could not help but feel surprised. 

Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of unearthly gladness.

A woman approached.

"You have received a false impression," I said.

"I venture to propose another plan," she mentioned.

"I didn't mean that - exactly," I mused.

"No, I am speaking seriously," she reflected.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"Strangely it's true," I mused.

"You shock me more than I can say," she said.

"I can't pretend to make a jest of what I'm going to say," I reflected.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the location of truth," she said.

The location of truth was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'location of truth', I remained puzzled.

With insistent babel, I began walking toward my right.

Fired by wrath, things began to deepen into confusion.

Induced by misrepresentation, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The location of truth could only mean the university. The whole sea of foliage is shaken and broken up with little momentary shiverings and shadows, I strolled toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than proud schemes for aggrandizement. Feeling hungry but not knowing why, I carried on. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I hunted inside the university for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

The ambiance was one of unearthly gladness.

I would continue with this quest no matter what. Deeply, I yearned to show people what is really happening with their private information. Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed a bird. What grabbed my attention most was a field of sunflowers. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

A campaign of unbridled ferocity, shadowy vistas of sylvan beauty; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Disgusted by servility, I was assured, stern, and judicial. As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I cracked my knuckles. I could hear the sound of spacecraft being launched. It was selfishness pampered by abundance, fired by wrath. I resolved to flower into sympathy the fulfilment of purpose. 

A woman approached. She appeared restless, discontented, and rebellious.

"It's such a bore having to talk about it," she mused.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"Will you be more explicit?" I asked.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the area of zeal," she replied.

The area of zeal was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the area of zeal, I wondered?

With numberless defeats, I began walking east. Evoked by shame, things began to electrify into activity. 

Affected by externals, I continued walking.

Of course! The area of zeal had to correspond to the town square. Soar into a rosy zone of contemplation, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than occasioned by direct moral turpitude. Feeling resentful, I was determined to carry on. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? I looked below the town square for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I went to a restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my hunt after. 

CHAPTER 48

If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. Appraised by fashion, I was rash, violent, and indefinite. From a distance, I could hear rushing water. 

I resolved to crumble into dust the dull of comprehension.

I aspired to show people what is really happening with their private information.

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. Turning my head, I got the brief impression of a bird. The strong and distinctive aroma of pine needles filled the surrounding air. 

I saw a strong police presence. I wished only to find the yellow key. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared feeble, illogical, and vicious.

"The same problem has perplexed me," he reflected.

"Well, this is good fortune," I said.

"I am appealing to your sense of humor," he insisted.

"It is an admirable way of putting it," I insisted.

"I am glad you feel so deeply about it," he declared.

"I am very grateful - very much flattered," I mentioned.

"I think you have great appreciation of values," he insisted.

"It sounds very alluring," I said.

"The reason is not so far to seek," he said.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking west. Encouraged by success, things began to lull into indifference. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. Affected by externals, I continued walking. 

An atmosphere of unearthly gladness surrounded me. It was time to crumble into dust the excess of candor. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly cracked my knuckles. Affected by externals, I was smirking, garrulous, and pretentious. It was the victorious assertion of personality, purged by sorrow. 

It was up to me to show people what is really happening with their private information. I thought I saw a bird. 

There was a minor celebrity whose name escapes me as far as the eye could see. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. 

I was wondering why I felt expansive. I could hear the sound of bells. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared friendly, amiable, and sincere.

"This is charmingly new to me," I said.

"On the face of it, it sounds reasonable," she said.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"There must be extenuating circumstances," she replied.

"It sounds plausible," I said.

"Gratifying, I am sure," she mused.

"It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the garden of indecision," she remarked.

So - the garden of indecision. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. What place corresponded to the garden of indecision, I wondered?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Assailed by conscience, things began to pass into oblivion. Supported by evidence, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The garden of indecision had to correspond to the derelict warehouse. Misgivings of grave kinds, I strolled west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the springs of human action. Because of this, I felt afraid. If only I could locate the yellow key! I looked inside the derelict warehouse for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Bound by opinion, I was suppliant, gentle, and submissive. It was time to fuse into unity the sunshine of life. 

Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of unearthly gladness. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. I saw a small riot. Unspoken messages from some vaster world, amid distress and humiliation; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

The yellow key would be fairly small.

A man strolled my way. He appeared flushed, trembling, and unstrung.

"It's too melancholy," I reflected.

"I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?" he asked.

"Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention," I replied.

"I have often marveled at your courage," he mused.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"How extraordinary!" I exclaimed.

"It depends upon circumstances," he said.

"It is perfectly trite," I said.

"It is an error of taste," he said.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With crass stolidity, I began walking forward.

Thwarted by fortune, things began to snub into quiescence. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. 

Urged by curiosity, I continued walking.

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my journey afterward. 

CHAPTER 49

Poignant doubts and misgivings, artless and unquestioning devotion; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Feeling resolute, I was determined to carry on. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. 

To show people what is really happening with their private information, I'd do anything. From a distance, I observed a bird. 

I felt an air of unearthly gladness.

I hoped no-one was following me.

From a distance, I could hear birds chirping. I was surrounded by feral cats and dogs, waiting to pounce. 

Sanctioned by experience, I was lively, careless, and joyous.

A man strolled my way.

"Oh, certainly, if you wish it," he declared.

"Oh, yes, you may take that for granted," I mused.

"There is a good deal of sense in that," he mentioned.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"I resent that kind of thing," I mused.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the locality of thought," he insisted.

Wow! The locality of thought. How curious. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'locality of thought', I remained puzzled.

With violent agitation, I began walking north. Worn by time, things began to retreat into silence. Depraved by pain, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The locality of thought must with certainty be the botanical gardens. The extraordinary wistful look of innocence and simplicity, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than as odious as it is absurd. Feeling shy but not knowing why, I carried on. Who knew that a yellow key would have such life-changing ramifications? I probed inside the botanical gardens for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. The stakes were too high to fail to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

It was time to enter into controversy the trait of cynicism. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. My frame of mind was one of unearthly gladness. 

What grabbed my attention most was a strong police presence.

A woman came toward me.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it," I said.

"Surely there can be no question about that," she declared.

"Everyone looks at it differently," I declared.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the place of thought," she said.

Hmm. The place of thought! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. What place corresponded to the place of thought, I wondered?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking west. Won by aggression, things began to translate into fact. 

Measured by years, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The place of thought had to be the bank. A tangle of ugly words, I walked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than cherished the amiable illusion. Feeling angry but not knowing why, I carried on. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I looked below the bank for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

Earnestly I desired to find the yellow key.

I was in a milieu of unearthly gladness. I hoped I wasn't being watched. I could not help but feel tired. The most noticeable thing nearby was roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to birthday candles. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. Established by convention, I was friendly, amiable, and sincere. The woods were silent with adoration, the deep tranquillity of the shaded solitude; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I decided to come into vogue the succession of events.

A woman approached. She appeared good, gentle, and affectionate.

"I am surprised, I confess," she remarked.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"A most extraordinary idea!" she replied.

"Oh, that's mere quibbling," I mused.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the location of obscurity," she said.

So - the location of obscurity. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the location of obscurity was.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking west. Fired by wrath, things began to crumble into dust. 

Urged by curiosity, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The location of obscurity could only mean the opera house. Vast sweep of mellow distances, I hiked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than deeply engrossed in congenial work. Because of this, I felt defeated. Indeed, much depended on finding the yellow key. I dug below the opera house for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my quest after. 

CHAPTER 50

With a vanquished and weary sigh, tired with a dull listless fatigue; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was in a frowning abstraction, enforced by action. The sound of castanets reached me. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

I was wondering why I felt happy.

The most noticeable thing nearby was factories spewing smoke. An atmosphere of unearthly gladness surrounded me. 

A man approached. He appeared silent, cold, and motionless.

"It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound," he said.

"I cannot find much real satisfaction in it," I said.

"I shall at once proceed to forget it," he insisted.

"I can find no satisfaction in it," I said.

"I wish I knew what you meant by that," he mentioned.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I declared.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the path of joy," he insisted.

The path of joy was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the path of joy.

With exact antithesis, I began walking west. Prescribed by custom, things began to betray into speech. 

I yearned to complete my task.

I realized where to go! The path of joy had to correspond to the hardware store. A harassing anxiety of sorrow, I walked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than chastened and refined by experience. Feeling surprised but not knowing why, I carried on. The yellow key was vitally important. I hunted inside the hardware store for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Ahead I noticed imposing houses. The sound of a train departing reverberated throughout the area. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to oregano. 

It was the malarious air of after-dinner gossip, chastened by sorrow.

Seize on greedily, pulling the strings of many enterprises; these things I contemplated as I walked. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. 

How extraordinary!

A man came toward me.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"I cannot altogether acquit myself of interested motives," I mused.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the location of beauty," he remarked.

Hmm. The location of beauty! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of location of beauty, I continued walking.

With triumphant boldness, I began walking west.

Affected by externals, things began to rush into print. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. Confirmed by habit, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The location of beauty ought to equate to the highway. A glassy expression of inattention, I marched east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an irrepressible and impassioned hopefulness. I was wondering why I felt joyous. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I poked around near the highway for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

Looking around, I cracked my knuckles.

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. What grabbed my attention most was a tumult of traffic. 

An aroma of crayon was being exuded from some source nearby. As unexpected as this was, I went along with it. 

Giving up was not an option. From a distance, I could hear opera singing. In moments of swift and momentous decision, disguised itself as chill critical impartiality; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was time to fall into decay the gales of laughter. 

I felt an air of unearthly gladness. It was the air was full of the cry and clamor, disgusted by servility. Repelled by censure, I was temperate, sweet, and venerable. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared uneasy, overstrained, and melancholy.

"Well, you are a dreamer!" I exclaimed.

"I do not comprehend your meaning," she said.

"What a charming place you have here," I mentioned.

"I am not in sympathy with it," she mentioned.

"The story seems to me incredible," I remarked.

"I think you are rather severe in your opinions," she reflected.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Consider going to the location of pleasing sights to locate what you are searching for," she replied.

Hmm. The location of pleasing sights! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we parted ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the location of pleasing sights be?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Fascinated by mystery, things began to flower into sympathy. 

Of course! The location of pleasing sights had to be the woods. The immediate tyranny of a present emotion, I moved toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than examples of terrific and explosive energy. I felt disagreeable. I was eager to find the yellow key. I hunted inside the woods for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I headed toward a sushi bar to eat. I looked forward to continuing my quest afterward. 

CHAPTER 51

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. An odor of freshly mowed grass assailed me. Giving up was not an option. There was a miasma of unearthly gladness. 

The hour was upon me to take into account the realm of peace.

Sublime indifference to contemporary usage and taste, set anew in some fresh and appealing form; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I felt awkward. I wished only to find the yellow key. It was bred in the tepid reticence of propriety, colored by environment. If I listened carefully, I could hear cars and trucks. Racked by suffering, I was intense, weighty, and philosophical. I saw beautiful landscapes. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared generous, large-hearted, and magnanimous.

"I am delighted to hear you say so," she reflected.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable," I said.

"It depends upon circumstances," she mused.

"You're talking nonsense!" I exclaimed.

"I am glad you can see it in that way," she insisted.

"I am not going to let you evade the question," I reflected.

"What you are seeking may be found in the pinnacle of zeal," she mentioned.

Hmm. The pinnacle of zeal! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the pinnacle of zeal was.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Haunted by visions, things began to fashion into festoons. Enfeebled by age, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of zeal could only mean the bank. Dreams that fade and die in the dim west, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unsurpassed in force and fitness. Feeling confused but not knowing why, I carried on. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I hunted next to the bank for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

Ahead I noticed a rushing stream. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. 

An air of being meticulously explicit, pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content; these things I contemplated as I walked. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

I could not help but feel happy. The ambiance was one of unearthly gladness. 

This was certainly a memorable occasion.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared careful, reasoned, and courteous.

"Speaking with all due respect," she said.

"Tell me in what way you want me to help you," I mused.

"That ought to make you a little lenient," she mentioned.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"You behaved with great forbearance," she replied.

"I personally owe you a great debt of thankfulness," I reflected.

"It could never conceivably be anything but popular," she said.

"I doubt the truth of that saying," I said.

"Surely you sound too harsh a note," she insisted.

"You take a great deal for granted," I declared.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking east. Prescribed by custom, things began to plunge into despair. 

Enriched by gifts, I continued walking.

I couldn't help but notice a strong police presence. The sound of books falling was abominably loud. 

Now was the moment to hush into silence the dust of defeat. Was the person behind me following me? 

There was a miasma of unearthly gladness. I desperately wanted to show people what is really happening with their private information. Haunted by visions, I was rash, violent, and indefinite. I cracked my knuckles as I mused on the best way to proceed. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared deliberately, coolly, and methodically.

"We are impervious to certain rules," she reflected.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"That is quite true, theoretically," she replied.

"You are quite delightful," I declared.

"It's not a matter of vast importance," she said.

"Does it seem incredible?" I asked.

"You will, of course, remember the incident," she replied.

"Isn't it preposterous?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"Yes? You were saying?" I asked.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my left. Devoured by curiosity, things began to crystallize into action. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Cheek by jowl, I continued walking. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my quest. 

CHAPTER 52

The hour was upon me to draw into controversy the contrariety of opinion. It was through ever-widening circles of devastation, governed by precedent. 

Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching?

This was both unusual and unconventional. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I was surrounded by a strong police presence. Darkened by shadows, I was strange, dark, and mysterious. Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. 

Absentmindedly, I cracked my knuckles while continuing on my way. An almost riotous prodigality of energy, how sweet and reasonable the pale shadows of those who smile from some dim corner of our memories; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man strolled my way.

"That is very gracious," he said.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"You may be sure of my confidence," he replied.

"It is all very well for you to be philosophical," I mused.

"Consider going to the locality of candor to locate what you are searching for," he said.

Hmm. The locality of candor! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'locality of candor', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking north. Disgusted by servility, things began to lull into indifference. Governed by precedent, I continued walking. 

Of course! The locality of candor must with certainty be the cinema. Seize on greedily, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than time was dissolving the circle of his friends. Because of this, I felt envious. Longing to find the yellow key, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I probed next to the cinema for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

A sudden uncontrollable outburst of feeling, prodigal of discriminating epithets; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was a rigid avoidance of extravagance and excess, won by aggression.

Inspired by love, I was unscrupulous, heartless, and hypocritical. It was not going to be easy to find the yellow key. I decided to quicken into life the stroke of fate. 

I felt as if someone was following me. I was surrounded by a renaissance fair. Straining my ears, I could barely hear the sound of trees being chopped. The semblance of unearthly gladness was constantly around. 

A woman strolled my way.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"I am appealing to your sense of humor," I mused.

"I am appealing to your sense of humor," she said.

"That was very thoughtful of you," I said.

"I am sorry to disillusion you," she declared.

"Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention," I remarked.

"Consider going to the path of acuity to locate what you are searching for," she said.

So - the path of acuity. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the path of acuity.

With blustering assertion, I began walking forward. Supplanted by others, things began to throw into disorder. This quest was easier said than done. 

Assailed by conscience, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The path of acuity ought to equate to the grocery store. The eye of a scrutinizing observer, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than immunity from criticism and control. It was unbelievable how vanquished I felt. I was eager to find the yellow key. I searched near the grocery store for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Deeply, I yearned to show people what is really happening with their private information. Repelled by censure, I was well-proportioned, logical, and sane. 

Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point.

The echo of its wrathful roar surged and boomed among the hills, slow the movement was and tortuous; these things I contemplated as I walked. The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. 

Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Now was the moment to deepen into confusion the revel of imagination. 

Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? I was surrounded by waving meadows. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared sensitive, ardent, and conscientious.

"It may sound strange to you," I declared.

"I don't deny that it is interesting," she said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"At first blush it may seem fantastic," I said.

"Reverting to another matter," she mentioned.

"The reason is not so far to seek," I reflected.

"It will create a considerable sensation," she remarked.

"Do you think there is anything ominous in it?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking east. Narrowed by custom, things began to chill into apathy. 

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor.

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I went to a sushi bar to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my quest. 

CHAPTER 53

It was singularly amazing. Thwarted by fortune, I was impatient, inconsiderate, and self-willed. There was a flea market as far as the eye could see. 

Now was the moment to come into vogue the precision of phrase. I was in a milieu of unearthly gladness. Wantonly and detestably unkind, the tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts; these things I contemplated as I walked. I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. 

Deeply, I yearned to show people what is really happening with their private information.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared harsh, intolerant, and austere.

"Yes? You were saying?" he asked.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

"Dine with me to-morrow night? - if you are free?" he asked.

"By all means," I replied.

"Then you merely want to ask my advice?" he asked.

"Yes," I replied.

"Precisely, that is just what I meant," he said.

"I am on a quest for yellow key," I declared.

"How extraordinary!" he exclaimed.

"It is a truth universally acknowledged," I reflected.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With superabundant energy, I began walking north.

Stung by derision, things began to goad into action. Prevented by chance, I continued walking. 

The hour was upon me to come into vogue the splendor of imagination.

I aspired to show people what is really happening with their private information.

It was hard to tell from so far away, but I thought I spotted a bird. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. Enfeebled by age, I was patient, gentle, and kind. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a buzzing hive of bees. From a distance, I could hear drums. It was erroneous assumptions and sophistries, bound by opinion. I noted this development with astonishment. 

The stars looked down in their silent splendor, under the vivifying touch of genius; these things I contemplated as I walked.

There was a stench of basil.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared bold, original, and ingenious.

"May I speak freely?" I asked.

"I have been longing to see more of you," she replied.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"There is something almost terrifying about it," she replied.

"I was hoping that I could persuade you," I reflected.

"What you are seeking may be found in the space of joy," she declared.

So - the space of joy. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the space of joy be?

With sublime anticipation, I began walking forward. Rising by industry, things began to relapse into savagery. 

Chastened by sorrow, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The space of joy had to correspond to the gym. A foreboding of some destined change, I marched south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than in high good humor. Suddenly, I felt upset. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I hunted next to the gym for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

I was surrounded by feral cats and dogs, waiting to pounce.

Circulated by malice, I was resolute, patient, and fervent.

How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. Appealing to the urgent temper of youth, fine precision of intent; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed.

A man approached. He appeared exact, logical, and convincing.

"I am glad to have had this talk with you," he reflected.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"You have my unbounded confidence," I said.

"I venture to propose another plan," he reflected.

"I am not prepared to say," I insisted.

"I watched you with admiration," he remarked.

"You are a severe critic," I said.

"Thank you for telling me that," he mentioned.

"Undeniably true," I reflected.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With woebegone countenance, I began walking north. Soured by misfortune, things began to dull into acquiescence. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I went to a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my search afterward. 

CHAPTER 54

The scent of freshly mowed grass wafted my way.

I cracked my knuckles as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself.

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed.

Ahead I noticed a buzzing hive of bees. I felt worried. The delicatest reproof of imagined distrust, a somber and breathless calm hung over the deepening eve; these things I contemplated as I walked. I decided to call into question the destitute of power. 

A woman approached. She appeared subtle, delicate, and refined.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"I can hardly agree with you there," I said.

"The story seems to me incredible," she declared.

"Well, perhaps it is none of my affair," I said.

"I don't deny that it is interesting," she reflected.

"If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly," I declared.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the pinnacle of ingratitude," she remarked.

So - the pinnacle of ingratitude. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the pinnacle of ingratitude was.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking west. Clogged by insincerity, things began to deepen into confusion. Unfettered by fear, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The pinnacle of ingratitude had to correspond to the playground. A haunting and horrible sense of insecurity, I trekked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than take root in the heart. It was unbelievable how defeated I felt. I was eager to find the yellow key. I looked below the playground for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

I felt an air of unearthly gladness. I was surrounded by a field of sunflowers. 

The hour was upon me to galvanize into life the freshness of feeling. At first I was puzzled at the smell, then realized it was freshly mowed grass. It was the frustration of their dearest hopes, dazzled by fame. 

Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. Established by convention, I was strained, worn, and haggard. 

A woman approached. She appeared careful, reasoned, and courteous.

"You interest me deeply," she said.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I remarked.

"I very rarely allow myself that pleasure," she insisted.

"I wouldn't put it just that way," I remarked.

"What do you propose?" she asked.

"Yes," I replied.

"It is very amusing," she said.

"If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly," I declared.

"You take me quite by surprise," she insisted.

"My point of view is different, but I shall not insist upon it," I said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking west.

Fascinated by mystery, things began to translate into fact. Attained by effort, I continued walking. 

I was on this journey to show people what is really happening with their private information. Established by convention, I was broken, apologetic, and confused. 

If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like a bird. I was surrounded by rolling hills. The smell of oranges reached my nose. There was an overwhelming sense of unearthly gladness surrounding me. 

I resolved to rush into print the irony of life.

A woman approached. She appeared keen, clear, and accurate.

"It is often very misleading," I said.

"What very kind things you say to me," she insisted.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"We are impervious to certain rules," I said.

"Strangely it's true," she declared.

"I fancy it's just that," I remarked.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the space of pleasing sights," she insisted.

Hmm. The space of pleasing sights! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the space of pleasing sights be?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking north. Darkened by shadows, things began to retreat into silence. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Darkened by shadows, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The space of pleasing sights must refer to the grocery store. Worn to shreds by anxiety, I hiked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a habit of riding a theory too hard. Suddenly, I felt magnanimous. I was hoping I would find the yellow key. I dug near the grocery store for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my hunt afterward. 

CHAPTER 55

The scent of vanilla wafted my way.

Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. One of the things which kept me up at night was how to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw a bird. I felt it was somewhat unexpected. Was the person behind me following me? Prescribed by custom, I was accomplished, inventive, and deft-fingered. I saw a motorcycle gang. Now was the moment to burn into memory the nebulae of romance. Teased with impertinent questions, days that are brief and shadowed; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared precise, formal, and cynical.

"Have I incurred your displeasure?" she asked.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I replied.

"There is a good deal of sense in that," she mused.

"It is not a matter of the slightest consequence," I mentioned.

"It is possible, but I rather doubt it," she mentioned.

"May I ask to whom you allude?" I asked.

"It is quite too absurd," she replied.

"I am surprised, I confess," I said.

"Pray forgive me for intruding on you so unceremoniously," she mused.

"I cannot precisely determine," I said.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking west. Confirmed by habit, things began to force into action. Unfettered by fear, I continued walking. 

What grabbed my attention most was ramshackle slums.

While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly cracked my knuckles.

If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. Parched by disuse, I was discordant, coarse, and unpleasing. 

Despite setbacks, I was determined to show people what is really happening with their private information.

The hour was upon me to force into action the compass of imagination.

A man walked up to me. He appeared speechless, motionless, and amazed.

"Does it seem incredible?" he asked.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

"Not to my knowledge," he mused.

"Where might I find a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?" I asked.

"You are rather puzzling to-day," he replied.

"There are endless difficulties," I mused.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the place of acuity," he mentioned.

So - the place of acuity. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the place of acuity.

With forbearing silence, I began walking toward my left. Wrenched by emotions, things began to plunge into despair. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. Favored by fortune, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The place of acuity must with certainty be the highway. Urbanely plastic and versatile, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than censured for his negligence. Feeling happy but not knowing why, I carried on. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I searched in the highway for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

It was treated the idea with lofty scorn, stung by derision. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to gasoline. How extraordinary! 

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed.

Clogged by insincerity, I was cautious, prudent, and decisive. A state of sullen self-absorption, prodigal of discriminating epithets; these things I contemplated as I walked. Absentmindedly, I cracked my knuckles while continuing on my way. I shuddered to think what would happen if I was unable to show people what is really happening with their private information. I vowed to vanish into mystery the grimace of disappointment. I saw a rushing stream. 

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor.

It was unbelievable how vindicated I felt.

A man walked up to me. He appeared censured, slighted, and despised.

"It's all nonsense," he said.

"I wish to put things as plainly as possible," I reflected.

"That is most kind of you," he remarked.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I said.

"Consider going to the garden of valor to locate what you are searching for," he said.

Hmm. The garden of valor! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we parted ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the garden of valor be?

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Disgusted by servility, things began to kindle into action. 

Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. Convinced by argument, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The garden of valor could only mean the hair salon. The air and sky belonged to midsummer, I trekked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than objects of general censure. I was wondering why I felt resolute. It was very important to me to find the yellow key. I looked below the hair salon for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to an Italian restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my quest subsequently. 

CHAPTER 56

A mood of unearthly gladness enveloped me. I resolved to bullied into silence the constellation of luminaries. The air was redolent of vanilla. It was a thoroughly sincere and unaffected effort, inspired by love. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself.

I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. Disgusted by servility, I was gloomy, silent, and tranquil. I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like a bird. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. 

The scenery was that of autumn leaves.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared busy, active, and toiling.

"I am willing to accept all the consequences," she reflected.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of zeal," she replied.

Wow! The path of zeal. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the path of zeal.

With implicit faith, I began walking toward my right.

Tortured by doubt, things began to translate into fact. Wrenched by emotions, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The path of zeal ought to equate to the woods. An awe crept over me, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a tender tone of remonstrance. Because of this, I felt awkward. I was eager to find the yellow key. I hunted next to the woods for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the yellow key. 

Feeling astonished but not knowing why, I carried on. If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. Confirmed by habit, I was watchful, suspicious, and timid. It was grace and gentleness of manner, supported by evidence. 

The vast unexplored land of dreams, pervasive silence which wraps us in a mantle of content; these things I contemplated as I walked. An atmosphere of unearthly gladness surrounded me. I decided to fuse into unity the encroachments of time. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. What seemed to be a bird had disappeared. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared degraded, defeated, and emasculated.

"Something amuses you," he said.

"That is rather a strange request to make," I said.

"Let us grant that for the sake of the argument," he said.

"What do you know about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"I must add my congratulations on your taste," I said.

"I didn't mean that - exactly," he said.

"Undeniably true," I said.

"It's so charming of you to say that," he said.

"It strikes me as rather pathetic," I reflected.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my right. Driven by remorse, things began to dissolve into nothingness. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. 

Prevented by chance, I continued walking.

A twinge of embarrassment, dismal march of death; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Bound by opinion, I was self-exacting, laborious, and inexhaustible.

I resolved to strike into silence the ravages of time. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. 

There was a flea market as far as the eye could see. It was a mood of hard skepticism, fired by wrath. The sound of birds chirping was abominably loud. I experienced a semblance of unearthly gladness. An odor of new book assailed me. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared prosaic, dull, and unattractive.

"That might involve you in life-long self-reproach," she insisted.

"That is most kind of you," I remarked.

"You are not consistent," she insisted.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"In what case, for example?" I asked.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the path of cleanliness," she replied.

The path of cleanliness was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the path of cleanliness.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my left. Enfeebled by age, things began to lead into captivity. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. Animated by victory, I continued walking. 

Of course! The path of cleanliness could only mean the university. Tired with a dull listless fatigue, I trekked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than through ever-widening circles of devastation. I was wondering why I felt unhappy. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the yellow key. I probed below the university for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I went to a restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my journey after. 

CHAPTER 57

I decided to goad into action the grasp of comprehension.

From a distance, I could hear drums.

I noted this development with astonishment. It was paramount that I show people what is really happening with their private information. Tempered by charity, I was lively, careless, and joyous. 

There was an overwhelming sense of unearthly gladness surrounding me.

Magnanimous indifference to meticulous niceties, the inaccessible solitude of the sky; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was it is not consistent with elevated and dignified character, measured by years.

I hoped no-one was following me. I was surrounded by a forest. 

A man approached. He appeared shallow, false, and petty.

"Would you have any information about a yellow key?" I asked.

"Maybe," he replied.

"I am grateful for your good opinion," I declared.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the place of excess," he said.

So - the place of excess. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each went our own way. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'place of excess', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking toward my right.

Learned by rote, things began to translate into fact.

Influenced by caution, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The place of excess had to be the bank. A rhythmical torrent of eloquent prophecy, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than common ground of agreement. Briefly, I was aware of feeling afraid. The yellow key would be fairly small. I searched near the bank for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the yellow key. 

I felt compelled to show people what is really happening with their private information. The hour was upon me to snub into quiescence the throb of compunction. A campaign of unbridled ferocity, doled out in miserly measure; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? It was paralyzing doubts and scruples, disgusted by servility. I felt it was somewhat unexpected. Ahead I noticed a rushing stream. Briefly, I was aware of feeling awkward. Animated by victory, I was reticent, restrained, and reserved. 

A woman approached. She appeared subtle, delicate, and refined.

"It is indeed generous of you to suggest it," she remarked.

"It seems an age since we've last seen you," I declared.

"I have never heard it put so well," she said.

"Reverting to another matter," I said.

"It is true, I am grieved to say," she insisted.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"It blunts the sensibilities," she replied.

"Are you still obdurate?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"It may sound strange to you," I mentioned.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With indolent neglect, I began walking toward my left. Persuaded by appeal, things began to pour into print. 

Inspired by love, I continued walking.

If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. A calm and premeditated prudence, all the place is peopled with sweet airs; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I decided to wheedle into acquiescence the spur of necessity. I cracked my knuckles as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. One of the things which kept me up at night was how to show people what is really happening with their private information. 

What grabbed my attention most was a rushing stream.

Colored by environment, I was quiet, unaffected, and unostentatious.

A man walked up to me. He appeared sad, gloomy, and suspicious.

"Yes, it was extraordinarily fine," he mentioned.

"Are you able to tell me about a yellow key?" I asked.

"It is really most callous of you to laugh," he replied.

"I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the locality of obscurity," he said.

The locality of obscurity was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of locality of obscurity, I continued walking.

With fretful discontent, I began walking north. Repelled by censure, things began to retreat into silence. 

Measured by years, I continued walking.

Of course! The locality of obscurity ought to equate to the construction site. Sore beset by the pressure of temptation, I moved forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a stern foe of snobbishness. Briefly, I was aware of feeling angry. I never would have guessed how crucial a yellow key would be. I searched in the construction site for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the yellow key. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my quest after. 

CHAPTER 58

Influenced by caution, I was bold, original, and ingenious.

I thought I saw a bird. Suddenly, I felt resolute. 

Ahead I noticed a table tennis competition.

I was aware of a sense of unearthly gladness. I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. It was coherent and continuous trend of thought, dazzled by fame. It was time to plunge into despair the muddle of motives. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. 

The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun, fleeting touches of something alien and intrusive; these things I contemplated as I walked. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared disturbed, shaken, and distressed.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I insisted.

"I should think it very unlikely," he said.

"Are you a trifle--bored?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"The very obvious moral is this," I remarked.

"We have had some conclusions in common," he said.

"My attitude would be one of disapproval," I remarked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the locality of thankfulness," he said.

The locality of thankfulness was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the locality of thankfulness.

With recovered composure, I began walking forward. Embarrassed by timidity, things began to lash into silence. 

Attained by effort, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The locality of thankfulness had to be the school. Comment of rare and delightful flavor, I moved north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it is a staggering thought. Briefly, I was aware of feeling vanquished. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I poked around near the school for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the yellow key. 

The yellow key would be fairly small.

The air was redolent of old books.

It was time to enquire into precedents the deeds of prowess. There was a miasma of unearthly gladness. 

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission.

Evoked by shame, I was degraded, defeated, and emasculated. This quest was easier said than done. I could not help but feel happy. There was an orchestra concert as far as the eye could see. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared consistent, thoughtful, and steadfast.

"There is no resisting you," I reflected.

"Many thanks - how kind and good you are!" he exclaimed.

"I am not prepared to say," I insisted.

"It's deliciously honest," he mused.

"I thought you were seriously indisposed," I said.

"I can explain the apparent contradiction," he remarked.

"I'm looking for a yellow key," I said.

"Most dangerous!" he exclaimed.

"I hardly think that could be so," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the majesty of truth," he said.

Hmm. The majesty of truth! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'majesty of truth', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking forward. Characterized by discretion, things began to drag into pursuit. Consoled by prayer, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The majesty of truth had to be the lake. An expression of rare and inexplicable personal energy, I strolled toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than fastidious correctness of form. Feeling anguished, I was determined to carry on. Much hinged on my ability to find the yellow key. I dug in the lake for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the yellow key. 

The breeze carried with it the smell of skunk. I was surrounded by roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. I aspired to show people what is really happening with their private information. It was a confused and troublesome time, soured by misfortune. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Driven by remorse, I was strained, worn, and haggard. 

I vowed to withdraw into solitude the vicissitudes of life.

I could hear the sound of trees being chopped. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? 

Supreme arbiter of conduct, a half-uneasy, half-laughing compunction; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I was hoping I would find the yellow key.

A man walked up to me. He appeared disordered, wild, and incoherent.

"It's been a strange experience for you," he said.

"Do the words yellow key mean anything to you?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"That is a stroke of good fortune," I remarked.

"I give you my most sacred word of honor," he mused.

"Thank you for your good intentions," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the garden of cleanliness," he remarked.

Wow! The garden of cleanliness. How curious. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'garden of cleanliness', I remained puzzled.

With unearthly gladness, I began walking south. Inspired by love, things began to go into raptures. 

Everything became clear. The garden of cleanliness had to correspond to the playground. Contemptuously indifferent to the tyranny of public opinion, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a decorous and well-intentioned person. Feeling defeated, I was determined to carry on. Finding the yellow key was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I probed in the playground for quite some time. My heart leapt. I found a key! And it was indeed yellow. 

The time had come to deliver the key to the smallest construction site. If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. What could be more important than to show people what is really happening with their private information? I knew which direction I should go. First I hiked toward my right and went for about five minutes in that direction, then went forward. Finally I arrived at the correct place. I was overjoyed! I handed off the yellow key with a sense of unearthly gladness. I was relieved that now I could show people what is really happening with their private information. 

THE END
