rolling hills
tall buildings
beautiful landscapes
imposing houses
big trees
a tumult of traffic
chaos and disorder
trash and food scraps lying around
feral cats and dogs, waiting to pounce
hamsters burrowing
a gaping hole in the road
a buzzing hive of bees
stores and shopping malls
a smelly landfill
boarded-up and dilapidated houses
factories spewing smoke
a forest
a calm lake
a rushing stream
autumn leaves
small gravel lanes
waving meadows
a renaissance fair
a small riot
an unusually large goat
a dusty plain
a hive of scum and villainy
a fetid swamp
a field of sunflowers
a strong police presence
a motorcycle gang
a group of children playing tag
ramshackle slums
a group of mimes
a minor celebrity whose name escapes me
an orchestra concert
a suburban street
plumbing supplies
a flea market
roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods
several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed
a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me
a table tennis competition
two people playing chess
