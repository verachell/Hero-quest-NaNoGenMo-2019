# The search for the platinum fountain pen

CHAPTER 1

My quest started with abject submission and ended with broadening fame.

I desired above all to discover the enemy's plans. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. The good news was that by finding the platinum fountain pen, I would discover the enemy's plans. There was one catch though - I had to deliver the item to the newest university. 

Sick, ashamed, and disillusioned, I commenced my hunt. I perceived meteors that dart like screaming birds. 

CHAPTER 2

The hour was upon me to beguile into reading the luxuriance of expression.

Long intertangled lines of silver streamlets, haunt the recesses of the memory; these things I contemplated as I walked. The strong and distinctive aroma of oranges filled the surrounding air. I ran my fingers through my hair as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. 

Tormented by jealousy, I was violent, sinister, and rebellious. If I listened carefully, I could hear a train departing. 

It was in a spirit of friendliness and conciliation, repelled by censure.

What grabbed my attention most was an unusually large goat. I'm male with short hair and hazel eyes. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared methodical, sensible, and conscientious.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"I am not in sympathy with it," I remarked.

"You astonish me greatly," she insisted.

"I can only tell you the bare facts," I reflected.

"It is nevertheless true," she remarked.

"There is something almost terrifying about it," I mentioned.

"Oh, yes, you may take that for granted," she said.

"I cannot forbear to press my advantage," I said.

"It is permissible to gratify such an impulse," she mused.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With warped purpose, I began walking forward.

Narrowed by custom, things began to fade into insignificance. I'm medium height and I like to watch TV. Enfeebled by age, I continued walking. 

I vowed to drag into pursuit the twinge of envy. In front of me was a renaissance fair. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to new book. It was the incursions of a venomous rabble, consoled by prayer. I had a brief glimpse of screaming birds. Normally I work as a airplane mechanic, but fortunately I was able to take some vacation days. A tone of bells reached my ears. Days of vague and fantastic melancholy, the foreground was incredibly shabby; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I desperately wanted to discover the enemy's plans.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared courteous, patient, and indefatigable.

"I will, with great pleasure," she said.

"This is a most unexpected pleasure," I said.

"Show me that the two cases are analogous," she declared.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"The reason is not so far to seek," I insisted.

"My information is rather scanty," she reflected.

"It is possible, but I rather doubt it," I insisted.

"To me it's simply outrageous," she reflected.

"Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me," I said.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With abject submission, I began walking south.

Appraised by fashion, things began to kindle into action.

Refuted by reason, I continued walking.

Soured by misfortune, I was safe, sensible, and sane. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. 

It was arbitrary assumption of power, fettered by systems. The most noticeable thing nearby was a renaissance fair. The sound of a cat meowing reached me. A little jaded by gastronomical exertions, blithe with the bliss of the morning; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I resolved to force into action the domain of imagination.

A man strolled my way.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Fortunate, to say the least," he replied.

"What you have just said is even truer than you realize," I declared.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the area of competence," he remarked.

The area of competence was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the area of competence was.

With mathematical precision, I began walking north.

Purged by sorrow, things began to hush into silence. Unfettered by fear, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The area of competence could only mean the bank. A kind of ineffable splendor crowns the day, I marched south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than mingled distrust and fear. I was wondering why I felt hungry. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I probed in the bank for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my quest afterward. 

CHAPTER 3

Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. There was a flea market as far as the eye could see. Dazzled by fame, I was assured, stern, and judicial. It was driven towards disaffection and violence, wrenched by emotions. 

I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to swamp. Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I was in a milieu of abject submission. I wanted to call up my friend Victor, but what would I say? How could I explain this situation? The irresistible and ceaseless onflow of time, the wind piped drearily; these things I contemplated as I walked. Now was the moment to render into music the sigh of wind. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared rough, barren, and unsightly.

"I confess, I find it difficult," she reflected.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Will you be more explicit?" she answered with another question.

"By all means," I replied.

"Go to the expanse of entreaty, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

So - the expanse of entreaty. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the expanse of entreaty.

With abject submission, I began walking toward my right. Enjoined by religion, things began to flame into war. I found it hard to believe that just last week I was going out to the bar with my friends after work. 

Influenced by caution, I continued walking.

Of course! The expanse of entreaty could only mean the highway. The irresistible and ceaseless onflow of time, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than incapable of flashy make-believe. It was unbelievable how resolute I felt. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I searched next to the highway for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided to flower into sympathy the waste of opportunity.

Unadorned by artifice, I was calm, earnest, and genial. It was men of profound erudition, ballasted by brains. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. The scenery was that of a flea market. 

Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw screaming birds.

Exquisitely stung by the thought, armed all over with subtle antagonisms; these things I contemplated as I walked.

To improve my mood, I thought about one of my favorite things: gardening.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared crisp, emphatic, and powerful.

"I feel very grateful to you for your kind offer," she remarked.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I mentioned.

"It is often very misleading," she mentioned.

"And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy me," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the area of indecision," she said.

The area of indecision was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the area of indecision be?

With abject submission, I began walking south. Darkened by shadows, things began to carry into conflict. Confirmed by habit, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The area of indecision ought to equate to the wine shop. Moments of utter idleness and insipidity, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than strange frankness of cynical brutality. Suddenly, I felt abandoned. Finding the platinum fountain pen was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I probed in the wine shop for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Established by convention, I was immethodical, irregular, and inconsecutive.

For some reason, I started contemplating one of my major dislikes: raking leaves. I was in a somber mood, purge the soul of nonsense; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

What grabbed my attention most was a rushing stream. The resonance of cars and trucks was in the air. 

A woman strode in my direction.

"It was so incredible," she insisted.

"What a charming place you have here," I reflected.

"I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment," she said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"I cannot see how you draw that conclusion," I declared.

"I am deeply flattered and grateful," she said.

"At first blush it may seem fantastic," I said.

"What can you possibly mean?" she asked.

"It seems entirely wonderful to me," I replied.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With cold formalities, I began walking north. Soured by misfortune, things began to lead into captivity. Deep in thought, I began reminiscing about the time in my childhood when I ran away from home, only it didn't work because my parents found me really quickly. Urged by curiosity, I continued walking. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 4

I vowed to come into vogue the trend of consciousness.

These qualities were raised to the white heat of enthusiasm, a first faint trace of irritation; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The sound of trees rustling reached me.

The ambiance was one of abject submission. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. What grabbed my attention most was rolling hills. It was hard to tell from so far away, but I thought I spotted screaming birds. Undaunted by failure, I was amiable, genial, and charitable. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared gloomy, silent, and tranquil.

"Of course, but that again isn't the point," I said.

"It is extremely interesting, I can assure you," she mentioned.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It will create a considerable sensation," she replied.

"How can I thank you?" I asked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the garden of thought," she replied.

Wow! The garden of thought. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the garden of thought was.

With bellicose humanity, I began walking forward.

Portray by words, things began to lead into captivity. I began wishing my friend Blake was here, who is unorthodox, but very patient. Unadorned by artifice, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The garden of thought had to correspond to the town square. Enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a mood of hard skepticism. Briefly, I was aware of feeling angry. I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be. I probed next to the town square for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly ran my fingers through my hair.

It was coarse and glittering ostentation, encouraged by success. The melody of a party surrounded me. Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. 

A crop of disappointments, the irrevocable past and the uncertain future; these things I contemplated as I walked. I desperately wanted to discover the enemy's plans. 

Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of abject submission. There was an orchestra concert as far as the eye could see. 

Soured by misfortune, I was wilful, wanton, and deliberate. I thought I saw screaming birds. I decided to elevate into importance the confidence of genius. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared uneasy, overstrained, and melancholy.

"That will suit me excellently," he said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Unquestionably superior," he replied.

"I partly agree with you," I reflected.

"What you are seeking may be found in the locality of pleasing sights," he said.

So - the locality of pleasing sights. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the locality of pleasing sights was.

With abject submission, I began walking forward. Induced by misrepresentation, things began to rush into print. Governed by precedent, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The locality of pleasing sights ought to equate to the bathroom. A dire monotony of bookish idiom, I trekked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than innumerable and incessant creations. Feeling confused but not knowing why, I carried on. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I looked inside the bathroom for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Tormented by jealousy, I was discordant, coarse, and unpleasing. Now was the moment to vanish into mystery the pit of oblivion. I ran my fingers through my hair. There was waving meadows as far as the eye could see. 

The murmuring of summer seas, transcendental contempt for money; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was a furtive groping after knowledge, tortured by doubt. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. 

A woman approached. She appeared unbending, contemptuous, and scornful.

"What an extraordinary idea!" I exclaimed.

"The subject is extremely interesting," she remarked.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I reflected.

"It is historically true," she said.

"We are drifting away from our point," I mused.

"Precisely, that is just what I meant," she reflected.

"Yes, if you will be so good," I mentioned.

"I am still a little of an idealist," she said.

"I cannot imagine what you mean," I said.

"It is possible, but I rather doubt it," she said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With matchless charm, I began walking east.

Sanctioned by experience, things began to burn into memory. Prevented by chance, I continued walking. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my journey. 

CHAPTER 5

There was an overwhelming sense of abject submission surrounding me. Governed by precedent, I was pleased, interested, and delighted. When this is all over, I look forward to playing video games. 

Finding the platinum fountain pen was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. It was in a transport of ambitious vanity, repelled by censure. 

Fathomless depths of suffering, it moved me to a strange exhilaration; these things I contemplated as I walked. A tone of coffee being made reached my ears. Ahead I noticed rolling hills. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared flushed, trembling, and unstrung.

"Don't delude yourself," she remarked.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"I have a peculiar affection for it," she mused.

"May I ask to whom you allude?" I asked.

"I don't make myself clear, I see," she replied.

"I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility," I declared.

"What you are seeking may be found in the path of joy," she remarked.

So - the path of joy. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the path of joy was.

With incoherent loquacity, I began walking toward my right. Rising by industry, things began to crystallize into action. 

Consoled by prayer, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The path of joy had to be the zoo. All was instinctive and spontaneous, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the want of serious and sustained thinking. I tried not to let it show, but I felt cheerful. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I poked around below the zoo for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

The rising storm of words, a glittering infectious smile; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was dimly implying some sort of jest, portray by words. What grabbed my attention most was a renaissance fair. 

I decided to launch into disapproval the crudity of thought. With avidity, I longed to discover the enemy's plans. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared deliberately, coolly, and methodically.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Consider going to the location of ingratitude to locate what you are searching for," she declared.

Wow! The location of ingratitude. How curious. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the location of ingratitude be?

With verbose manner, I began walking forward. Restrained by violence, things began to chill into apathy. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

I realized where to go! The location of ingratitude must with certainty be the town square. The timely effusion of tearful sentiment, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than torn asunder by eternal strife. I could not help but feel angry. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked next to the town square for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

It was keen power of calculation and unhesitating audacity, enriched by gifts. Worn by time, I was amiable, genial, and charitable. Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. Ahead I noticed tall buildings. 

Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw screaming birds. Looking around, I ran my fingers through my hair. Now was the moment to deepen into confusion the extravagance of eulogy. It was unbelievable how surprised I felt. I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. Somehow I smelled a whiff of freshly mowed grass. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared pleasant, friendly, and amiable.

"But, wait, you haven't heard the end," I said.

"I am perfectly aware of what I am saying," he said.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I think you have summed it up perfectly," he replied.

"There must be extenuating circumstances," I remarked.

"I must take this opportunity to tell you," he declared.

"It's absolute folly," I declared.

"We shall be glad to see you, if you care to come," he said.

"I am ready to make great allowances," I said.

"It always seemed to me impossible," he mused.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With winning plaintiveness, I began walking toward my right.

Fascinated by mystery, things began to strike into silence. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my hunt subsequently. 

CHAPTER 6

I was in a milieu of abject submission. Evoked by shame, I was pompous, affected, and unreal. The hour was upon me to flower into sympathy the perturbation of mind. Power to assuage the thirst of the soul, unspoiled by praise or blame; these things I contemplated as I walked. In front of me was a table tennis competition. Was it a figment of my imagination, or did I see screaming birds? Feeling vindicated, I was determined to carry on. 

It was advancing to dignity and honor, refuted by reason.

I yearned to complete my task.

A man walked up to me. He appeared adventurous, eager, and afraid.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the expanse of indecision," he replied.

The expanse of indecision was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the expanse of indecision.

With esoteric doctrine, I began walking toward my right. Influenced by caution, things began to render into music. Convinced by argument, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The expanse of indecision must refer to the hardware store. Agitated with violent and contending emotions, I trekked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the flippant insolence of a decadent skepticism. I tried not to let it show, but I felt envious. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched inside the hardware store for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

It was torn asunder by eternal strife, devoured by curiosity.

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor.

The scenery was that of tall buildings. Briefly, I was aware of feeling worried. The ambition and rivalship of men, the irrevocable past and the uncertain future; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Measured by years, I was defeated, discredited, and despised. Now was the moment to plunge into despair the dull of comprehension. 

An image etched on a rock nearby reminded me of screaming birds. The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. 

A man approached. He appeared opulent, powerful, and prosperous.

"It's deliciously honest," he said.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the majesty of thought," he replied.

Ah. The majesty of thought. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of majesty of thought.

With disfiguring disguise, I began walking east. Forbid by authority, things began to snub into quiescence. 

Fettered by systems, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The majesty of thought ought to equate to the museum. The melancholy day weeps in monotonous despair, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than arrayed with scrupulous neatness. Feeling elated but not knowing why, I carried on. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I poked around in the museum for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived screaming birds. The scars of rancor and remorse, a sense of infinite peace brooded over the place; these things I contemplated as I walked. Urged by curiosity, I was feeble, illogical, and vicious. The most noticeable thing nearby was a suburban street. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. I resolved to bring into disrepute the vow of allegiance. 

I felt it was somewhat unexpected.

A woman came toward me. She appeared ugly, scowling, and offensive.

"And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy me," I mentioned.

"Show me that the two cases are analogous," she said.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"One has no choice to endure it," she insisted.

"I am afraid I am not familiar enough with the subject," I reflected.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the principality of arguments," she remarked.

So - the principality of arguments. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the principality of arguments.

With unreasonable pretense, I began walking forward. Portray by words, things began to cringe into favor. Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. Prompted by coquetry, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The principality of arguments had to be the bank. A murmur of complacency, I trekked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than peculiarly liable to misinterpretation. Briefly, I was aware of feeling unhappy. It was not going to be easy to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched inside the bank for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. Encouraged, I found my way to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 7

It was the impulse of prejudice or caprice, confirmed by habit. Won by aggression, I was melancholy, grave, and serious. A murmur of complacency, an ingratiating, awkward and, wistful grace; these things I contemplated as I walked. Now was the moment to deepen into confusion the suspicion of flattery. Feeling awkward, I was determined to carry on. 

Ahead I noticed a rushing stream.

I was shocked at this. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared opulent, powerful, and prosperous.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"I think you are quibbling," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the location of entreaty," he declared.

The location of entreaty was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of location of entreaty.

With abject submission, I began walking north.

Established by convention, things began to cringe into favor.

Ballasted by brains, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The location of entreaty must with certainty be the bank. A twinge of embarrassment, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a narrow and superficial survey. Feeling resentful but not knowing why, I carried on. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I looked near the bank for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Although difficult to distinguish, I caught a flash of screaming birds. Learned by rote, I was temperate, sweet, and venerable. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. 

The most noticeable thing nearby was small gravel lanes. The stream forgot to smile, the memory of the night grew fantastic and remote; these things I contemplated as I walked. An aura of abject submission pervaded the surroundings. It was the brunt of life, affected by externals. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared resourceful, steadfast, and skilful.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"I am surprised, I confess," he declared.

"Have you any rooted objection to it?" I asked.

"Consider going to the area of obscurity to locate what you are searching for," he replied.

Hmm. The area of obscurity! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of area of obscurity.

With unsurpassed purity, I began walking south.

Clogged by insincerity, things began to electrify into activity. Forbid by authority, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The area of obscurity could only mean the discount store. A vast sweet silence crept through the trees, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the gratification of ambition. Feeling afraid but not knowing why, I carried on. Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I dug near the discount store for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Racked by suffering, I was pale, ugly, and sinister. There was a group of mimes as far as the eye could see. Somehow I smelled a whiff of raw sewage. A heavy oppression seemed to brood upon the air, a tumult of vehement feeling; these things I contemplated as I walked. This was both unusual and unconventional. It was credulous and emotionally extravagant, devoured by curiosity. Feeling disagreeable, I was determined to carry on. Giving up was not an option. Now was the moment to wander into digression the vehicle of intercourse. 

A man came toward me. He appeared pleased, interested, and delighted.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"You are quite delightful," he replied.

"It's absurd - it's impossible," I declared.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the majesty of indecision," he mused.

Wow! The majesty of indecision. How curious. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the majesty of indecision was.

With abject submission, I began walking west. Driven by remorse, things began to fuse into unity. Affected by externals, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The majesty of indecision had to be the opera house. The artificial smile of languor, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the precarious tenure of fame. I was wondering why I felt magnanimous. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed inside the opera house for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I went to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 8

Guided by instinct, I was insincere, partial, and arbitrary. It was time to fall into decay the monstrosities of character. 

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. An odor of swamp assailed me. The semblance of abject submission was constantly around. 

Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it.

It was a high pitch of eloquence, narrowed by custom. Resounding generalities and conventional rhetoric, in a gale of teasing merriment; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Feeling resolute, I was determined to carry on. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a smelly landfill. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared irritable, sulky, and furious.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"I have something of great importance to say to you," I said.

"It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject," she insisted.

"I should like your opinion of it," I said.

"Go to the space of candor, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

Hmm. The space of candor! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we parted ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the space of candor be?

With exasperating coolness, I began walking west. Fortified by faith, things began to transform into beauty. Circulated by malice, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The space of candor had to correspond to the aviary. Browsing at will on all the uplands of knowledge and thought, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unrivaled beauty and excellence. Because of this, I felt upset. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed in the aviary for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. I vowed to transform into beauty the age of ignorance. What grabbed my attention most was plumbing supplies. Induced by misrepresentation, I was gradual, cautious, and well-reasoned. 

This was certainly a memorable occasion.

The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared self-absorbed, conceited, and contemptuous.

"It is wanton capriciousness," she said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"Tell me in what way you want me to help you," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the path of pleasing sights," she said.

So - the path of pleasing sights. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the path of pleasing sights.

With consequent retribution, I began walking toward my right. Disgusted by servility, things began to draw into controversy. Refuted by reason, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The path of pleasing sights had to correspond to the courthouse. A late star lingered, remotely burning, I walked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the victim of an increasing irritability. Briefly, I was aware of feeling tired. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I poked around inside the courthouse for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I would continue with this quest no matter what. The most noticeable thing nearby was a renaissance fair. 

How could I live with myself if I didn't discover the enemy's plans? It was time to render into music the dream of vengeance. It was the menacing shadow of want, chastened by sorrow. A loudness of trees rustling pervaded the region. I was shocked at this. Lapse into pathos and absurdity, a blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

The smell of cinnamon reached my nose.

A man walked up to me. He appeared powerful, dazzling, and daring.

"Quibbling, I call it," he said.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Consider going to the area of knowledge to locate what you are searching for," he remarked.

Hmm. The area of knowledge! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of area of knowledge.

With overhanging darkness, I began walking north. Restrained by violence, things began to bullied into silence. 

Refuted by reason, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The area of knowledge had to be the hair salon. Swift summer into the autumn flowed, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than embittered and fanatical agitation. I was wondering why I felt tired. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I looked inside the hair salon for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I headed toward a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my quest. 

CHAPTER 9

Attained by effort, I was pleased, interested, and delighted. It was pitiful shifts of policy, enriched by gifts. The scenery was that of rolling hills. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. The hour was upon me to wheedle into acquiescence the crudity of thought. Involved in a labyrinth of perplexities, redolent of the night lamp; these things I contemplated as I walked. The air was resonant with the sound of cows mooing. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared anxious, fearful, and anticipative.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"If you insist upon it," she replied.

"You don't seem very enthusiastic," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the pinnacle of zeal," she said.

The pinnacle of zeal was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of pinnacle of zeal, I continued walking.

With gaudy embellishments, I began walking west. Unadorned by artifice, I continued walking. 

Of course! The pinnacle of zeal had to correspond to the courthouse. The immediate tyranny of a present emotion, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than plunged into tumultuous preoccupation. Feeling awkward but not knowing why, I carried on. Finding the platinum fountain pen was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I probed next to the courthouse for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. Occasioned by irritation, I was pious, patient, and trustful. Outweighing years of sorrow and bitterness, subtle suggestions of remoteness; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was delicacy of perception and quick tact, rising by industry. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I saw tall buildings. Now was the moment to galvanize into life the object of contempt. I desired above all to discover the enemy's plans. I noticed the faint sound of cars and trucks. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared unscrupulous, heartless, and hypocritical.

"I was hoping that I could persuade you," she said.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Oh, do not form an erroneous impression," she replied.

"I hardly think that could be so," I remarked.

"Consider going to the pinnacle of ingratitude to locate what you are searching for," she said.

Hmm. The pinnacle of ingratitude! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we parted ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of pinnacle of ingratitude.

With abject submission, I began walking toward my right. Marked by acuteness, things began to fade into insignificance. Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. 

Undaunted by failure, I continued walking.

Of course! The pinnacle of ingratitude could only mean the duck pond. Pledged with enthusiastic fervor, I walked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the charming omniscience of youth. Because of this, I felt resolute. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked near the duck pond for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Despite setbacks, I was determined to discover the enemy's plans. It was the handmaid of tyranny, narrowed by custom. 

An uncomfortable premonition of fear, a fine arrogant acrimony and harsh truculence; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A tone of someone playing the recorder very badly reached my ears.

What grabbed my attention most was an unusually large goat. I resolved to crumble into dust the trace of bitterness. It was unbelievable how disappointed I felt. I thought I saw screaming birds. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared bold, original, and ingenious.

"You are quite delightful," she said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"The sentiment is worthy of you," she replied.

"That is not to be lightly spoken of," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the place of obscurity," she declared.

So - the place of obscurity. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each went our own way. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'place of obscurity', I remained puzzled.

With abject submission, I began walking forward. Evoked by shame, things began to crumble into dust. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Prevented by chance, I continued walking. 

Of course! The place of obscurity had to be the duck pond. Marked out for some strange and preternatural doom, I moved toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a mixture of malignancy and madness. I was wondering why I felt unhappy. This platinum fountain pen was of paramount significance. I looked below the duck pond for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I went to a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my hunt. 

CHAPTER 10

It was delicacy of perception and quick tact, fired by wrath.

Ahead I noticed ramshackle slums.

Tempered by charity, I was dogmatic, scientific, and philosophic.

I ran my fingers through my hair as I mused on the best way to proceed. I resolved to fuse into unity the threshold of consciousness. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? 

The pungent stink of fresh popcorn filled my nostrils.

A man strolled my way. He appeared affected, pedantic, and vain.

"There are endless difficulties," he mused.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the principality of thought," he replied.

Hmm. The principality of thought! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the principality of thought.

With flawless constitution, I began walking west. Soured by misfortune, things began to rush into print. 

Attained by effort, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The principality of thought must with certainty be the lake. Wantonly and detestably unkind, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a mood of hard skepticism. I could not help but feel afraid. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. I looked in the lake for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

It was unbelievable how expansive I felt.

I vowed to hush into silence the impetuosity of youth.

I would continue with this quest no matter what.

It was appeal to a tardy justice, undone by treachery. Prevented by chance, I was officious, fidgety, and talkative. The sky was a relentless, changeless blue, the irrevocable past and the uncertain future; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Ahead I noticed a fetid swamp.

I felt it was somewhat unexpected.

A man approached. He appeared furious, sanguinary, and disorganizing.

"That is not to be lightly spoken of," I said.

"I am suppressing many of the details," he insisted.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" he replied.

"My meaning is quite the contrary," I declared.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the majesty of obscurity," he declared.

The majesty of obscurity was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the majesty of obscurity was.

With agreeable frankness, I began walking forward. Soured by misfortune, things began to strike into silence. 

Animated by victory, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The majesty of obscurity had to correspond to the courthouse. An assumption of hostile intent, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than feigning a virtuous indignation. Because of this, I felt awkward. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I poked around below the courthouse for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

The sound of a train departing was abominably loud. In front of me was trash and food scraps lying around. This quest was easier said than done. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. I decided to resolve into nothingness the deeds of prowess. 

The mind freezes at the thought, through endless and labyrinthine sentences; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was sullen and widespread discontent, favored by fortune.

A man came toward me. He appeared openly, frankly, and legitimately.

"I doubt the truth of that saying," he said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"It should not be objectionable," I insisted.

"Will you be more explicit?" he asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the majesty of ingratitude," he said.

Ah. The majesty of ingratitude. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the majesty of ingratitude was.

With abject submission, I began walking toward my right. Forbid by authority, things began to force into action. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The majesty of ingratitude could only mean the bakery. An exquisite perception of things beautiful and rare, I walked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the unimpeachable correctness of his demeanor. Suddenly, I felt worried. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed below the bakery for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. Encouraged, I found my way to a restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my search after. 

CHAPTER 11

Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Because of this, I felt hungry. I felt an air of abject submission. I couldn't help but notice a rushing stream. I hoped no-one was following me. 

Fascinated by mystery, I was busy, active, and toiling. Comment of rare and delightful flavor, a super-refinement of taste; these things I contemplated as I walked. I decided to leap into currency the intuition of immortality. 

It was tempered by the emotional warmth of high moral ideals, beset by difficulties.

A man came toward me. He appeared smirking, garrulous, and pretentious.

"You interest me deeply," he said.

"Don't be so dismal, please," I remarked.

"You have been wrongly informed," he mentioned.

"The very obvious moral is this," I said.

"Thank you for your good intentions," he said.

"Yes? You were saying?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"Do you mind my making a suggestion?" I asked.

"That is eminently proper," he replied.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With wearisome wordiness, I began walking toward my left. Convinced by argument, I continued walking. 

I vowed to force into action the realm of peace.

Quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth, the bait proved incredibly successful; these things I contemplated as I walked. Disgusted by servility, I was ugly, scowling, and offensive. 

There was several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed as far as the eye could see.

It was vast and vague aspirations, assailed by conscience.

Feeling astonished, I was determined to carry on.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared petty, unsuccessful, and unamiable.

"Do you press me to tell?" she asked.

"I wish I knew!" I replied.

"You are very complimentary," she reflected.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I see you are an enthusiast," she replied.

"Everyone looks at it differently," I insisted.

"Go to the expanse of eminence, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she mused.

Wow! The expanse of eminence. How curious. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the expanse of eminence.

With abject submission, I began walking south.

Parched by disuse, things began to fall into decay. Allayed by sympathy, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The expanse of eminence must with certainty be the abandoned home. The naked fact of death, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than habits of unintelligent routine. I tried not to let it show, but I felt hot. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched next to the abandoned home for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of abject submission. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. 

The smell of freshly baked bread reached my nose. That which flutters the brain for a moment, the immediate tyranny of a present emotion; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I vowed to bring into disrepute the pit of oblivion.

Tormented by jealousy, I was good, gentle, and affectionate. I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. 

Ahead I noticed feral cats and dogs, waiting to pounce. While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly ran my fingers through my hair. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared violent, sinister, and rebellious.

"My views are altered in many respects," he said.

"You are very complimentary," I mused.

"But perhaps I'm hardly fair when I say that," he declared.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"One has no choice to endure it," he replied.

"It is often very misleading," I mused.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the expanse of eminence," he remarked.

Ah. The expanse of eminence. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the expanse of eminence, I wondered?

With abject submission, I began walking south.

Thwarted by fortune, things began to pass into oblivion. 

Thwarted by fortune, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The expanse of eminence must refer to the university. Tense with the anguish of spiritual struggle, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a shrewd eye to the main chance. It was unbelievable how shy I felt. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched inside the university for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I went to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I looked forward to continuing my hunt afterward. 

CHAPTER 12

I decided to resolve into nothingness the garlands of roses. I felt worried. Attained by effort, I was perplexed, tedious, and obscure. 

Leaping from lambent flame into eager and passionate fire, supreme arbiter of conduct; these things I contemplated as I walked. I noted this development with astonishment. I couldn't help but notice plumbing supplies. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared affected, pedantic, and vain.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable," I declared.

"I hadn't thought of it in that light," he reflected.

"It is your privilege to think so," I mentioned.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of entreaty," he said.

Wow! The principality of entreaty. How curious. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the principality of entreaty.

With abject submission, I began walking south. Dazzled by fame, things began to fade into insignificance. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Governed by precedent, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The principality of entreaty ought to equate to the bathroom. Spur and whip the tired mind into action, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an unparalleled and almost miraculous growth. I could not help but feel disappointed. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I searched inside the bathroom for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Allayed by sympathy, I was affluent, genial, and frank.

I was hoping I would find the platinum fountain pen. I felt it was somewhat unexpected. An odor of swamp assailed me. The hour was upon me to drag into pursuit the sentiment of disapprobation. The gloom of winter dwelt on everything, wrapped in scudding rain; these things I contemplated as I walked. I was surrounded by a suburban street. There was a miasma of abject submission. 

A woman approached. She appeared tedious, painful, and distressing.

"Well, this is good fortune," she mused.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I declared.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the garden of arguments," she reflected.

Hmm. The garden of arguments! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the garden of arguments was.

With conscious repugnance, I began walking east. Depraved by pain, things began to draw into controversy. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The garden of arguments must refer to the bank. Felicitousness in the choice and exquisiteness in the collocation of words, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a hopeless enigma. I felt confident. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I probed inside the bank for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

I vowed to dash into fragments the bent of mind.

Blown about by every wind of doctrine, in the air was the tang of spring; these things I contemplated as I walked. There was roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods as far as the eye could see. I felt an air of abject submission. Guided by instinct, I was confident, inflexible, and uncontrollable. It was universal in their signification, supplanted by others. 

A man approached. He appeared proud, reserved, and disagreeable.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Oh, that was a manner of speaking," he replied.

"Human nature interests me very much indeed," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of ingratitude," he declared.

Hmm. The principality of ingratitude! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the principality of ingratitude.

With loathsome oppression, I began walking west. Persuaded by appeal, things began to electrify into activity. Established by convention, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The principality of ingratitude ought to equate to the zoo. Struck dumb with strange surprise, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a unique and overwhelming charm. Suddenly, I felt stressed. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched in the zoo for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. I went to a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my search. 

CHAPTER 13

Worn by time, I was draggled, dirty, and slouching. Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. 

The scenery was that of imposing houses. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. What seemed to be screaming birds had disappeared. While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly ran my fingers through my hair. 

It was the mere fruit of his distempered imagination, stung by derision. Now was the moment to dissolve into nothingness the fury of resentment. I was aware of a sense of abject submission. A heavy oppression seemed to brood upon the air, a tumult of vehement feeling; these things I contemplated as I walked. I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared disturbed, shaken, and distressed.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the pinnacle of thought," he replied.

Wow! The pinnacle of thought. How curious. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the pinnacle of thought was.

With patent example, I began walking toward my right.

Influenced by caution, things began to draw into controversy. Inculcated by practise, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of thought had to correspond to the car dealership. A murmur of complacency, I walked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a fitting interval for penitence. Feeling hopeful, I was determined to carry on. This platinum fountain pen was of paramount significance. I probed below the car dealership for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a minor celebrity whose name escapes me. The tone betrayed a curious irritation, the narrow glen was full of the brooding power of one universal spirit; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was the perpetrator of clumsy witticisms, marked by acuteness. The breeze carried with it the smell of crayon. I decided to dull into acquiescence the pinnacle of favor. 

Clogged by insincerity, I was genial, frank, and confiding. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared stiff, decorous, and formal.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I declared.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of eminence," she remarked.

The path of eminence was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the path of eminence, I wondered?

With abject submission, I began walking north.

Embarrassed by timidity, things began to strike into silence. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Condemned by posterity, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The path of eminence must with certainty be the town square. The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity, I strolled west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the lowest grade of precarious mendacity. Feeling confused but not knowing why, I carried on. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. I poked around in the town square for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

What could be more important than to discover the enemy's plans? I vowed to dash into fragments the glare of scrutiny. 

The most noticeable thing nearby was autumn leaves. Persuaded by appeal, I was confident, inflexible, and uncontrollable. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared pleased, interested, and delighted.

"It is very ingenious," I reflected.

"It will not alter my determination," he said.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the location of thankfulness," he replied.

The location of thankfulness was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of location of thankfulness.

With unfathomable indifference, I began walking forward.

Won by aggression, things began to pour into print. Undetermined by sorrow, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The location of thankfulness had to be the cafe. A mouth of inflexible decision, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a proposition inherently vicious. I was wondering why I felt confident. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed next to the cafe for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I went to a pub to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 14

It was a duel of brains, refuted by reason. In front of me was a suburban street. Tormented by jealousy, I was unbending, contemptuous, and scornful. 

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind.

It was time to sink into insignificance the feast of reason. I ran my fingers through my hair as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. 

A man came toward me. He appeared smirking, garrulous, and pretentious.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Surely you sound too harsh a note," he replied.

"It was very good of you to come out and join us," I mentioned.

"Go to the pinnacle of entreaty, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he said.

Ah. The pinnacle of entreaty. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the pinnacle of entreaty was.

With abject submission, I began walking west. Persuaded by appeal, things began to come into vogue. Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The pinnacle of entreaty ought to equate to the gym. In a spirit of indulgent irony, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than advance by leaps and bounds. Suddenly, I felt confused. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I probed next to the gym for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

From a distance, I could hear a lawnmower. It was protracted to a vexatious length, driven by remorse. I was wondering why I felt angry. 

This quest was easier said than done.

This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry.

I decided to plunge into despair the vestige of regard. There was a distinct odor of fart. I was surrounded by a minor celebrity whose name escapes me. I was aware of a sense of abject submission. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? The gray air rang and rippled with lark music, the tone betrayed a curious irritation; these things I contemplated as I walked. Although difficult to distinguish, I caught a flash of screaming birds. Narrowed by custom, I was disordered, wild, and incoherent. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared safe, sensible, and sane.

"I am so glad you think that," he mentioned.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"I don't insist on your believing me," he said.

"It is my deliberately formed opinion," I reflected.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the expanse of cleanliness," he declared.

The expanse of cleanliness was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the expanse of cleanliness was.

With abject submission, I began walking west.

Unadorned by artifice, things began to withdraw into solitude. Occasioned by irritation, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The expanse of cleanliness must with certainty be the lake. A calm and premeditated prudence, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a sane philosophy of life. I was wondering why I felt cold. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I looked in the lake for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

I vowed to fuse into unity the field of activity. At first I was puzzled at the smell, then realized it was gasoline. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? What grabbed my attention most was ramshackle slums. I aspired to discover the enemy's plans. I noted this development with astonishment. A creature of the most delicate and rapid responses, urbanely plastic and versatile; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was the dumb forces of brute nature, portray by words. Circulated by malice, I was assured, stern, and judicial. Suddenly, I felt stressed. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared stiff, decorous, and formal.

"You have had a pleasant time, I hope," he mused.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"It has a lovely situation as I remember it," I mentioned.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the gate of beauty," he said.

Ah. The gate of beauty. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the gate of beauty.

With geological enigma, I began walking east. Consoled by prayer, things began to usher into society. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Allayed by sympathy, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The gate of beauty ought to equate to the lake. The afternoon was filled with sound and sunshine, I trekked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a quenchless thirst for expression. Briefly, I was aware of feeling happy. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. I hunted below the lake for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward an Italian restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my hunt afterward. 

CHAPTER 15

As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I ran my fingers through my hair. Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed screaming birds. Beset with smiling hills, freedom and integrity of soul; these things I contemplated as I walked. Ahead I noticed a renaissance fair. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to birthday candles. I decided to go into raptures the universality of experience. Confirmed by habit, I was decent, respectable, and sensible. The stakes were too high to fail to discover the enemy's plans. 

A man approached. He appeared fervently, patiently, and persistently.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I am willing to accept all the consequences," he replied.

"Of course I am delighted," I mentioned.

"That is true and I think you are right," he said.

"I am absolutely bewildered," I mentioned.

"Let me speak frankly," he said.

"What you propose is utterly impossible," I said.

"It must be fascinating," he reflected.

"I fear that's too technical for me," I mentioned.

"It is really most callous of you to laugh," he said.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With amusing artlessness, I began walking forward. Refuted by reason, things began to betray into speech. 

Unfettered by fear, I was apt, explicit, and communicative. The sound of spacecraft being launched reverberated throughout the area. The most noticeable thing nearby was roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. I vowed to degenerate into monotony the frigidity of address. Dimly, as though through mist, I noticed screaming birds. Life would be unbearable if I did not discover the enemy's plans. Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of abject submission. 

Reflecting the solemn and unfathomable stars, obsessed with the modishness of the hour; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was diversity of mind and temperament, inspired by love.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared genial, frank, and confiding.

"Yes, that is my earnest wish," she said.

"You overwhelm me with your kindness," I mentioned.

"Oh, yes, you may take that for granted," she mentioned.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"So much the better for me," I said.

"Please do not think I am asking out of mere curiosity," she insisted.

"You speak in enigmas," I reflected.

"Glorious to contemplate," she mentioned.

"I shall at once proceed to forget it," I said.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With abject submission, I began walking west. Vitalized by thought, things began to betray into speech. Persuaded by appeal, I continued walking. 

Now was the moment to melt into space the blaze of fury.

A mystery everlastingly impenetrable, an intense and insatiable hunger for light and truth; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The most noticeable thing nearby was a small riot.

Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen.

It was a sharp difference of opinion, won by aggression.

The semblance of abject submission was constantly around.

A man strolled my way.

"You see things rose-colored," he said.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"I am persuaded by your candor," he replied.

"It is I who should ask forgiveness," I said.

"I am not inquisitive," he reflected.

"What a tempting prospect!" I exclaimed.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the locality of sounds," he said.

The locality of sounds was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the locality of sounds was.

With abject submission, I began walking west. Clogged by insincerity, things began to kindle into action. Enriched by gifts, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The locality of sounds must with certainty be the zoo. Regarded with an exulting pride, I strode south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than admirable mastery of technique. Feeling disappointed, I was determined to carry on. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked below the zoo for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my search after. 

CHAPTER 16

I had a brief glimpse of screaming birds. 

I resolved to carry into conflict the perturbation of mind.

I could not help but feel stressed.

There was a cacaphony of welding. The shiver of the dusk passed fragrantly down the valley, the inaccessible solitude of the sky; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was under the sway of arbitrary opinions, prevented by chance. What grabbed my attention most was a gaping hole in the road. The stakes were too high to fail to discover the enemy's plans. I could not see this as anything but incredible. 

I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to vanilla.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared feeble, illogical, and vicious.

"Pardon me, but I don't think so," she said.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I declared.

"I think that is rather a brilliant idea," she reflected.

"How very surprising," I mused.

"Go to the space of confusion, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she declared.

Ah. The space of confusion. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the space of confusion.

With abject submission, I began walking north. Haunted by visions, things began to strike into silence. 

As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Thwarted by fortune, I continued walking. 

Of course! The space of confusion could only mean the derelict warehouse. An incursion of the loud, the vulgar and meretricious, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the stillness of finality. Because of this, I felt magnanimous. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I probed in the derelict warehouse for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

The melody of a cat meowing surrounded me. Evoked by shame, I was inert, torpid, and lethargic. I resolved to fall into decay the dawning of recognition. 

The ambiance was one of abject submission.

The smell of basil reached my nose.

Was it a figment of my imagination, or did I see screaming birds? In front of me was several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed. 

I aspired to discover the enemy's plans.

All the lesser lights paled into insignificance, a portent full of possible danger; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was an atmosphere of sunny gaiety, fettered by systems. 

A woman approached.

"Does it seem incredible?" I asked.

"It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss," she replied.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"Then you merely want to ask my advice?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"It sounds plausible," I said.

"Consider going to the gate of illusion to locate what you are searching for," she said.

Hmm. The gate of illusion! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of gate of illusion.

With beaming countenance, I began walking toward my left. Supported by evidence, things began to cringe into favor. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Encouraged by success, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The gate of illusion ought to equate to the art gallery. The eyes filled with playfulness and vivacity, I strode toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than quite destitute of resources. Suddenly, I felt anguished. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I looked below the art gallery for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I was shocked at this. I ran my fingers through my hair. Ahead I noticed several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed. I aspired to discover the enemy's plans. A ceaselessly fleeting sky, a covertly triumphant voice; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

It was pruned of their excrescences and grotesque extremes, affected by externals. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? The hour was upon me to withdraw into solitude the shade of doubt. An atmosphere of abject submission surrounded me. 

Undetermined by sorrow, I was sanguine, impulsive, and irrepressible. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. 

A woman approached. She appeared decent, respectable, and sensible.

"I have a hundred reasons for thinking so," she mused.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"Of course I don't want to press you against your will," I said.

"You are incorrigible," she said.

"Then you're really not disinclined?" I asked.

"What you have just said is even truer than you realize," she replied.

"I feel a certain apprehension," I said.

"We will devoutly hope not," she mentioned.

"Indeed, you are wholly wrong," I mused.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With abject submission, I began walking east. Prevented by chance, things began to bring into disrepute. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I went to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my search. 

CHAPTER 17

I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. The hour was upon me to quicken into life the wiles of innocence. The most noticeable thing nearby was a group of children playing tag. Impelled by duty, I was curious, fantastic, and charming. The general effect was of extraordinary lavish profusion, suddenly overawed by a strange, delicious shyness; these things I contemplated as I walked. Giving up was not an option. 

The melody of a party surrounded me. It was stupendous and awe-inspiring spectacle, unfettered by fear. 

A man came toward me. He appeared disturbed, shaken, and distressed.

"What a curious coincidence!" he exclaimed.

"I am not as unreasonable as you suppose," I mused.

"If you insist upon it," he said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of thought," he replied.

The principality of thought was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of principality of thought, I continued walking.

With lamentable helplessness, I began walking north. Colored by environment, things began to crystallize into action. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Undaunted by failure, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The principality of thought must refer to the zoo. The iron hand of oppression, I walked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than violent and unforeseen vicissitudes. I tried not to let it show, but I felt confident. It was not going to be easy to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched in the zoo for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Now was the moment to fashion into festoons the chimera of superstition. I was surrounded by small gravel lanes. 

Repelled by censure, I was shallow, false, and petty. I was aware of a sense of abject submission. 

How could I live with myself if I didn't discover the enemy's plans? It was arrogance and untutored haughtiness, parched by disuse. I could hear the sound of people talking. 

The mute melancholy landscape, the tune of moving feet in the lamplit city; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared unbending, contemptuous, and scornful.

"How amiable you are to say so," she mused.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Go to the expanse of ingratitude, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she remarked.

So - the expanse of ingratitude. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the expanse of ingratitude.

With blundering discourtesy, I began walking east. Soured by misfortune, things began to galvanize into life. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. 

Marked by acuteness, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The expanse of ingratitude had to correspond to the cinema. Bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a fund of curious information. I could not help but feel disagreeable. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I dug inside the cinema for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be. Ahead I noticed a table tennis competition. 

The hour was upon me to dissolve into nothingness the abatement of misery.

There was a stench of raw sewage. I desired above all to discover the enemy's plans. Parched by disuse, I was austere, calm, and somber. 

A mood of abject submission enveloped me. It was an utterly vile and detestable spirit, confirmed by habit. 

A man came toward me. He appeared false, wicked, and disloyal.

"I thoroughly agree with you," he said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Go to the garden of zeal, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he replied.

Wow! The garden of zeal. How curious. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the garden of zeal be?

With abject submission, I began walking south. Learned by rote, things began to force into action. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? Tempered by charity, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The garden of zeal must refer to the restaurant. The velvet of the cloudless sky grew darker, and the stars more luminous, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the hint of tranquillity and self-poise. I tried not to let it show, but I felt cold. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed near the restaurant for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I went to an Italian restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my search subsequently. 

CHAPTER 18

Radiant with the beautiful glamor of youth, the lofty grace of a prince; these things I contemplated as I walked. Ahead I noticed a minor celebrity whose name escapes me. I was in a milieu of abject submission. It was time to expand into weakness the glow of enthusiasm. 

Wrenched by emotions, I was feeble, illogical, and vicious. To discover the enemy's plans, I'd do anything. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! Absentmindedly, I ran my fingers through my hair while continuing on my way. 

I hoped no-one was following me.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared rapt, emotional, and mystic.

"It is simply a coincidence," I remarked.

"I am vastly obliged to you," she declared.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the location of beauty," she replied.

So - the location of beauty. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the location of beauty.

With abject submission, I began walking north. Evoked by shame, things began to crumble into dust. 

Characterized by discretion, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The location of beauty could only mean the museum. The swing of the pendulum through an arch of centuries, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the jargon of well-handled and voice-worn phrases. Because of this, I felt disagreeable. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I looked near the museum for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

With avidity, I longed to discover the enemy's plans.

I resolved to dull into acquiescence the element of compulsion. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. I noticed the faint sound of small animals scurrying. This little independent thread of inquiry, the mind freezes at the thought; these things I contemplated as I walked. Vitalized by thought, I was transparent, theatric, and insincere. 

I rubbed my eyes and looked again. What seemed to be screaming birds had disappeared.

I couldn't help but notice an unusually large goat.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared perplexed, tedious, and obscure.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Go to the space of valor, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he said.

So - the space of valor. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the space of valor.

With melancholy musing, I began walking west. Portray by words, things began to chill into apathy. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Urged by curiosity, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The space of valor must with certainty be the museum. Fluctuations of prosperity and adversity, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a species of moral usurpation. Suddenly, I felt elated. I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be. I dug in the museum for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Giving up was not an option.

The most noticeable thing nearby was small gravel lanes.

Under the vivifying touch of genius, a vivid and arresting presentation; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Rising by industry, I was watchful, suspicious, and timid. I ran my fingers through my hair as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. 

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. Briefly, I was aware of feeling hopeful. I resolved to beguile into reading the peals of laughter. The scent of gasoline wafted my way. 

A man came toward me. He appeared quiet, unaffected, and unostentatious.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"It's absolute folly," he said.

"But you must tell me more," I mused.

"That is eminently proper," he mentioned.

"Let us take a concrete instance," I mentioned.

"It is my deliberately formed opinion," he insisted.

"Quite the wisest thing you can do," I remarked.

"I wish to put things as plainly as possible," he declared.

"That is admirably clear," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the expanse of joy," he said.

Wow! The expanse of joy. How curious. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of expanse of joy, I continued walking.

With kindred sympathies, I began walking east. Undetermined by sorrow, things began to strike into silence. 

Occasioned by irritation, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The expanse of joy had to be the laundromat. Varnished over with a cold repellent cynicism, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than versed in the arts of exciting tumult and sedition. Feeling expansive but not knowing why, I carried on. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I dug next to the laundromat for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my hunt subsequently. 

CHAPTER 19

There was a miasma of abject submission. To speak with entire candor, a sense of infinite peace brooded over the place; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Favored by fortune, I was egotistic, disdainful, and proud.

It was a secret and wistful charm, learned by rote. There was a flea market as far as the eye could see. 

I hoped I wasn't being watched. I could not help but feel hopeful. 

I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. The stakes were too high to fail to discover the enemy's plans. I decided to fashion into festoons the perversity of chance. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared constant, wise, and sympathetic.

"Surely there can be no question about that," she said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Go to the gate of illusion, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she replied.

Ah. The gate of illusion. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of gate of illusion, I continued walking.

With mistrustful superiority, I began walking toward my left. Guided by instinct, things began to translate into fact. 

Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. Rising by industry, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The gate of illusion had to correspond to the lake. Stem the tide of opinion, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than noble and sublime patience. I was wondering why I felt uninspired. I was hoping I would find the platinum fountain pen. I hunted inside the lake for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

The hour was upon me to pour into print the piece of pedantry.

A somewhat melancholy indolence, bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise; these things I contemplated as I walked.

How extraordinary! It was a constant source of surprise and delight, prompted by coquetry. 

A tone of welding reached my ears. I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like screaming birds. Narrowed by custom, I was reticent, restrained, and reserved. 

I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. I saw a small riot. I was wondering why I felt ambivalent. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared grim, lean, and hungry.

"It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject," she reflected.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I insisted.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the area of thought," she said.

So - the area of thought. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the area of thought be?

With concrete realities, I began walking east. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Thwarted by fortune, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The area of thought had to correspond to the abandoned home. A sort of eager, almost appealing amiability, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than marvelous copiousness of illustration. It was unbelievable how cheerful I felt. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked in the abandoned home for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

The sound of someone giving a speech was abominably loud. Avert by prayer, I was sincere, placable, and generous. I felt compelled to discover the enemy's plans. Feeling confused but not knowing why, I carried on. 

I decided to bullied into silence the firmness of purpose. 

What grabbed my attention most was a suburban street. Life flowed in its accustomed stream, dull black eyes under their precipice of brows; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared false, wicked, and disloyal.

"I cannot imagine what you mean," she said.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"That is very felicitous," I remarked.

"It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject," she declared.

"It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound," I declared.

"The subject is extremely interesting," she said.

"I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration," I reflected.

"It is really most callous of you to laugh," she said.

"What a tempting prospect!" I exclaimed.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With improvising powers, I began walking west. Prevented by chance, things began to chill into apathy. 

I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable.

Influenced by caution, I continued walking.

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. Encouraged, I found my way to a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my quest. 

CHAPTER 20

The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small.

I have to admit I found this a little unexpected.

In front of me was a flea market. I capitulated by inadvertence, an uncomfortable premonition of fear; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was a breach of confidence, prescribed by custom. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? 

I was aware of a sense of abject submission. Marked by acuteness, I was insincere, partial, and arbitrary. I vowed to melt into space the cogency of argument. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared pleased, interested, and delighted.

"I like your frankness," he said.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Really? I should have thought otherwise," he said.

"I am grateful for your good opinion," I reflected.

"I wish I knew what you meant by that," he mused.

"I know it is very presumptuous," I reflected.

"Let me persuade you," he mused.

"It is literally impossible," I said.

"Consider going to the location of knowledge to locate what you are searching for," he reflected.

Wow! The location of knowledge. How curious. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I racked my brains. What on earth could the location of knowledge be?

With abject submission, I began walking toward my left. Sanctioned by experience, things began to galvanize into life. 

Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The location of knowledge could only mean the school. Blown about by every wind of doctrine, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than pleading the exigencies of strategical interest. I could not help but feel afraid. Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I looked next to the school for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it.

I saw hamsters burrowing. It was time to beguile into reading the puff of applause. Was the person behind me following me? It was deliberate and cautious reflection, favored by fortune. A profound and eager hopefulness, an air half quizzical and half deferential; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before.

A woman approached. She appeared disinterested, patient, and exact.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"The idea is monstrous," I said.

"By no means desirable, I think," she said.

"You ask me - but I shouldn't wonder if you knew better than I do," I declared.

"I can never be sufficiently grateful," she said.

"It is nevertheless true," I said.

"There is something almost terrifying about it," she insisted.

"Well, I call it scandalous," I mentioned.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of eminence," she insisted.

Hmm. The path of eminence! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the path of eminence be?

With unclouded splendor, I began walking north. Learned by rote, things began to call into question. 

Rising by industry, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The path of eminence must refer to the butterfly garden. Oddly disappointing and fickle, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a rigid avoidance of extravagance and excess. It was unbelievable how unhappy I felt. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I dug near the butterfly garden for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

The pungent stink of pine needles filled my nostrils. How extraordinary! Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. I was surrounded by ramshackle slums. The sound of a lawnmower was abominably loud. The evening star silvery and solitary on the girdle of the early night, the stars looked down in their silent splendor; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was time to melt into space the emotions of joy. My frame of mind was one of abject submission. 

Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. Bound by opinion, I was aggressive, envious, and arrogant. It was rigid and exact boundaries, supported by evidence. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared harsh, intolerant, and austere.

"It is true, I am grieved to say," she said.

"Are you not complicating the question?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the majesty of illusion," she replied.

The majesty of illusion was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the majesty of illusion be?

With abject submission, I began walking east. Restrained by violence, things began to flower into sympathy. Prompted by coquetry, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The majesty of illusion ought to equate to the shopping mall. Jealousies and animosities which pricked their sluggish blood to tingling, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than dull and trite commonplaces. I was wondering why I felt resolute. It was not going to be easy to find the platinum fountain pen. I hunted next to the shopping mall for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a sushi bar to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my journey after. 

CHAPTER 21

I was surrounded by an unusually large goat.

Worn by time, I was assured, stern, and judicial.

Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds. The maximum of attainable and communicable truth, this shadowy and chilling sentiment unaccountably creeps over me; these things I contemplated as I walked. The semblance of abject submission was constantly around. It was on a noble and commanding scale, tormented by jealousy. I vowed to come into vogue the weight of argument. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared melancholy, grave, and serious.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Have you anything definite in your mind?" she answered with another question.

"Maybe," I replied.

"You seem to be in a happy mood," she said.

"I don't pretend to explain," I insisted.

"We are drifting away from our point," she reflected.

"Apparently I was wrong," I mentioned.

"I have every reason to think so," she mused.

"The reason is not so far to seek," I said.

"It has never occurred to me," she insisted.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With pitiless precision, I began walking toward my left.

Bound by opinion, I continued walking.

While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly ran my fingers through my hair. The semblance of abject submission was constantly around. Measured by years, I was wasteful, indolent, and evasive. I tried not to let it show, but I felt ambivalent. It was the inflexible serenity of the wheeling sun, enfeebled by age. If I listened carefully, I could hear spacecraft being launched. The clouded, restless, jaded mood, the romantic ardor of a generous mind; these things I contemplated as I walked. The most noticeable thing nearby was a calm lake. I desperately wanted to discover the enemy's plans. Somehow I smelled a whiff of freshly mowed grass. 

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. I vowed to fuse into unity the trend of consciousness. This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. 

A man came toward me. He appeared placable, reasonable, and willing.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"You are a profound philosopher," he replied.

"It is true, I am grieved to say," I insisted.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the path of thought," he insisted.

Ah. The path of thought. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the path of thought.

With abject submission, I began walking forward. Beset by difficulties, things began to retreat into silence. Affected by externals, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The path of thought must refer to the convenience store. In a tumult of self-approval and towering exultation, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it must be a matter of conjecture. I could not help but feel abandoned. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I poked around in the convenience store for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. Occasioned by irritation, I was disturbed, shaken, and distressed. 

Until sleep overtakes us at a stride, variously ramified and delicately minute channels of expression; these things I contemplated as I walked. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. It was the collective life of humanity, enjoined by religion. 

The hour was upon me to plunge into despair the elevation of sentiment. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a buzzing hive of bees. Suddenly, I felt defeated. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared insincere, partial, and arbitrary.

"What are your misgivings?" she asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

"Your judgments are very sound," she said.

"I am extremely glad you approve of it," I insisted.

"I was hoping that I could persuade you," she remarked.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"That theory isn't tenable," she replied.

"Well, I'm not going to argue that," I mused.

"I am, I confess, a little discouraged," she mentioned.

"It was inevitable that you should say that," I said.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With accumulated burden, I began walking forward. Urged by curiosity, I continued walking. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. Encouraged, I found my way to a restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my journey. 

CHAPTER 22

The hour was upon me to goad into action the intensity of faith. Repelled by censure, I was oppressive, grasping, and slanderous. 

The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. 

It was a gambler's desperate chance, encouraged by success. Overshadowed by a vague depression, such was the petty chronicle; these things I contemplated as I walked. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. 

I saw roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. I had a brief glimpse of screaming birds. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared shivering, moaning, and weeping.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of candor," she replied.

Hmm. The principality of candor! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the principality of candor was.

With accentuated playfulness, I began walking east.

Fired by wrath, things began to degenerate into monotony. Favored by fortune, I continued walking. 

Of course! The principality of candor had to be the gym. The sky was turning to the pearly gray of dawn, I moved north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a wealth of resource that seemed inexhaustible. I was wondering why I felt hungry. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I dug in the gym for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

I would continue with this quest no matter what. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to cinnamon. I ran my fingers through my hair as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. I felt an air of abject submission. The most noticeable thing nearby was a strong police presence. I resolved to betray into speech the fervor of devotion. 

Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. The chivalrous homage of respect, pallor of reflected glories; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Circulated by malice, I was disinterested, patient, and exact. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? 

A woman approached. She appeared lively, careless, and joyous.

"It is historically true," she mentioned.

"I shall feel highly honored," I said.

"I don't want to exaggerate," she said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"That, at least, you will agree to," she replied.

"I am your creditor unawares," I mused.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the expanse of cleanliness," she mentioned.

Ah. The expanse of cleanliness. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the expanse of cleanliness.

With abject submission, I began walking east. Supplanted by others, things began to bring into disrepute. Vitalized by thought, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The expanse of cleanliness must with certainty be the opera house. The song of hurrying rivers, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the consequence of an agitated mind. Feeling afraid but not knowing why, I carried on. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. I dug in the opera house for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Rising by industry, I was narrow, precise, and formal.

In front of me was a field of sunflowers.

The pungent stink of gasoline filled my nostrils. It was in moments of the most imminent peril, repelled by censure. An atmosphere of abject submission surrounded me. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. 

Now was the moment to fall into decay the ductility of expression. They sit heavy on the soul, a fortuitous series of happy thoughts; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared venerable, patriotic, and virtuous.

"Happily there are exceptions to every rule," he said.

"You look incredulous," I mused.

"There is one inevitable condition," he declared.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"That would be somewhat serious," I declared.

"May I venture to ask what inference you would draw from that?" he asked.

"Maybe," I replied.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of learning," he reflected.

Wow! The principality of learning. How curious. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the principality of learning was.

With unreserved assent, I began walking east. Animated by victory, things began to expand into weakness. 

Depraved by pain, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The principality of learning ought to equate to the shopping mall. Touched every moment with shifting and enchanting beauty, I trekked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than warnings too pregnant to be disregarded. Briefly, I was aware of feeling disagreeable. I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be. I probed below the shopping mall for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. Encouraged, I found my way to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my journey. 

CHAPTER 23

There was a hive of scum and villainy as far as the eye could see. Undone by treachery, I was feeble, illogical, and vicious. The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. It was the ravening wolves of brute instinct, tortured by doubt. I hoped I wasn't being watched. I resolved to transform into beauty the annulment of influence. 

I could hear the sound of phones chiming. It was unbelievable how upset I felt. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared loitering, heart-sick, and reluctant.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the pinnacle of thankfulness," she replied.

So - the pinnacle of thankfulness. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we parted ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the pinnacle of thankfulness be?

With immoderate grief, I began walking north. Fired by wrath, things began to burn into memory. 

Portray by words, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The pinnacle of thankfulness must refer to the abandoned home. A glance of extraordinary meaning, I strode west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than irrelevant to the main issue. I was wondering why I felt hungry. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. I hunted inside the abandoned home for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

I was wondering why I felt awkward. In front of me was a field of sunflowers. Racked by suffering, I was overriding, arrogant, and quarrelsome. Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds. It was a fund of curious information, measured by years. 

Drowned in the deep reticence of the sea, luke-warm assurance of continued love; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was time to bring into disrepute the sigh of wind. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared sensitive, ardent, and conscientious.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I insisted.

"I have quite changed my opinion about that," he remarked.

"It will create a considerable sensation," I said.

"What a pretty compliment!" he exclaimed.

"I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise," I insisted.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the pinnacle of learning," he said.

The pinnacle of learning was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of pinnacle of learning, I continued walking.

With unwilling homage, I began walking forward.

Learned by rote, things began to galvanize into life.

Disgusted by servility, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of learning could only mean the construction site. A profound and absorbing interest, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a species of moral usurpation. It was unbelievable how surprised I felt. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I searched next to the construction site for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Purge the soul of nonsense, the zenith turned shell pink; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was daily usages and modes of thinking, beset by difficulties. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. I decided to go into raptures the outposts of morality. A stench of new book traveled on the air. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived screaming birds.

The scenery was that of a suburban street. Briefly, I was aware of feeling disappointed. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared bold, original, and ingenious.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Consider going to the place of thought to locate what you are searching for," she replied.

Hmm. The place of thought! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the place of thought be?

With dramatic liveliness, I began walking west. Prescribed by custom, things began to come into vogue. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Disgusted by servility, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The place of thought could only mean the museum. The river ran darkly, mysteriously by, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a pleasant flow of appropriate language. It was unbelievable how cold I felt. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. I dug below the museum for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. Encouraged, I found my way to a sushi bar to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my journey after. 

CHAPTER 24

Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. Stung by derision, I was monstrous, incredible, and inhuman. I vowed to flame into war the clash of arms. A melancholy monotone beat on one's heart, a wordless farewell; these things I contemplated as I walked. I felt resolute. 

I hoped no-one was following me. I saw trash and food scraps lying around. 

A woman approached.

"I am sensible of the flattery," she mentioned.

"What an extraordinary idea!" I exclaimed.

"I place myself entirely at your service," she declared.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Those things are not forgotten at once," she replied.

"In what case, for example?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"You speak in enigmas," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of thought," she mused.

So - the principality of thought. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the principality of thought, I wondered?

With emotional warmth, I began walking toward my right. Branded by defeat, things began to transform into beauty. Driven by remorse, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The principality of thought could only mean the bank. Products of dreaming indolence, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a signal deed of justice. I could not help but feel hot. I wished only to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around inside the bank for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

There was an orchestra concert as far as the eye could see.

Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds. I felt it was somewhat unexpected. An easy prey to the powers of folly, freighted with strange, vague longings; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Tortured by doubt, I was patient, gentle, and kind.

Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself.

I felt as if someone was following me. It was unbelievable how worried I felt. 

The hour was upon me to quicken into life the fitness of circumstance. It was omitting all compliments and commonplaces, occasioned by irritation. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared watchful, suspicious, and timid.

"Is it sane - is it reasonable?" she asked.

"Maybe," I replied.

"I could never forgive myself for that," she insisted.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"This is indeed good fortune," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the pinnacle of excess," she insisted.

Hmm. The pinnacle of excess! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the pinnacle of excess.

With abject submission, I began walking west. Favored by fortune, things began to throw into disorder. Enjoined by religion, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The pinnacle of excess could only mean the bank. The day sang itself into evening, I walked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a strong assumption of superiority. Feeling confused, I was determined to carry on. It was not going to be easy to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched near the bank for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Colored by environment, I was anxious, fearful, and anticipative. I couldn't help but notice beautiful landscapes. I felt as if someone was following me. The hour was upon me to hush into silence the grimace of disappointment. 

Indolently handsome eyes, preening its wings for a skyward flight; these things I contemplated as I walked.

It was dogged and shameless beyond all precedent, animated by victory.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared austere, calm, and somber.

"You speak with authority," she remarked.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"You are not seriously displeased with me?" I asked.

"I wish I knew what you meant by that," she replied.

"Then you merely want to ask my advice?" I asked.

"What you propose is utterly impossible," she replied.

"I think it has its charm," I insisted.

"Go to the space of zeal, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

Hmm. The space of zeal! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of space of zeal, I continued walking.

With abject submission, I began walking toward my right. Assailed by conscience, things began to strike into silence. This quest was easier said than done. 

Established by convention, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The space of zeal had to be the aviary. An ingratiating, awkward and, wistful grace, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the delimitation is sufficiently definite. Feeling stressed but not knowing why, I carried on. I wished only to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched next to the aviary for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my hunt. 

CHAPTER 25

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. I was surrounded by a fetid swamp. Branded by defeat, I was rash, violent, and indefinite. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? 

It was lucidity and argumentative vigor, worn by time. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived screaming birds. Now was the moment to lash into silence the fitness of circumstance. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared boisterous, undignified, and vulgar.

"It has a lovely situation as I remember it," I mentioned.

"You interest me deeply," she said.

"You're talking nonsense!" I exclaimed.

"Quite so," she said.

"Does it please you so tremendously?" I asked.

"It is your privilege to think so," she replied.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"It's a matter of immediate urgency," she mentioned.

"I seem to have heard that sentiment before," I said.

"Who is your sagacious adviser?" she asked.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With abject submission, I began walking toward my left.

Convinced by argument, I continued walking.

Prompted by coquetry, I was logical, clear, and consistent. As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I ran my fingers through my hair. I resolved to hush into silence the shuttle of life. I could not see this as anything but incredible. The blinding mist came down and hid the land, the machinations of a relentless mountebank; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Was the person behind me following me?

Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself.

Ahead I noticed trash and food scraps lying around. It was the strong hand of executive authority, dazzled by fame. 

A woman approached. She appeared striking, bold, and magnificent.

"I am really afraid I don't know," she reflected.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the principality of eminence," she declared.

The principality of eminence was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the principality of eminence.

With nameless fear, I began walking toward my right. Tortured by doubt, things began to rush into print. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The principality of eminence ought to equate to the shopping mall. The immediate tyranny of a present emotion, I hiked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the purse-proud inflation of the moneyed man. I could not help but feel anguished. I wished only to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked next to the shopping mall for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

I hoped I wasn't being watched. Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds. 

To discover the enemy's plans, I'd do anything. Lost in a delirious wonder, the demerit of an unworthy alliance; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

The most noticeable thing nearby was hamsters burrowing. As unexpected as this was, I went along with it. The hour was upon me to withdraw into solitude the eloquence of passion. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. An aura of abject submission pervaded the surroundings. 

The air was redolent of oregano. It was a very elusive and delicate thought, forbid by authority. 

A woman approached. She appeared desolated, impoverished, and embittered.

"Give me your sympathy and counsel," she remarked.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I remarked.

"I am luckily disengaged to-day," she declared.

"If ever I can repay it, command me," I said.

"It seems the height of absurdity," she mused.

"But who could foresee what was going to happen?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"It was an unpardonable liberty," I remarked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the path of zeal," she said.

Wow! The path of zeal. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the path of zeal, I wondered?

With abject submission, I began walking east. Tortured by doubt, things began to take into account. 

Driven by remorse, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The path of zeal ought to equate to the butterfly garden. A piteous aspect of woe, I hiked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the insipidity of indifference. I tried not to let it show, but I felt defeated. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I hunted below the butterfly garden for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I went to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my search afterward. 

CHAPTER 26

It was the expression was keenly intellectual, measured by years. Although difficult to distinguish, I caught a flash of screaming birds. 

Stung by derision, I was shy, wild, and provocative. I ran my fingers through my hair as I mused on the best way to proceed. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. The most noticeable thing nearby was a table tennis competition. It was unbelievable how awkward I felt. This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. The perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild fragrance, the leaves of time drop stealthily; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man came toward me. He appeared narrow, precise, and formal.

"It seems unspeakably funny to me," I said.

"That is just like you, if you will forgive me for saying so," he said.

"I wish to be perfectly fair," I remarked.

"I know my request will appear singular," he declared.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I mentioned.

"Really? I should have thought otherwise," he said.

"It seems the height of absurdity," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of beauty," he said.

So - the path of beauty. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the path of beauty, I wondered?

With abject submission, I began walking forward.

Portray by words, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The path of beauty had to correspond to the hardware store. Appalled in speechless disgust, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the flattest and most obvious truisms. I felt cold. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around next to the hardware store for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Vitalized by thought, I was mean, pitiful, and sordid. The incarnation of all loveliness, specious show of impeccability; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was admitted with a childlike cheerfulness, inculcated by practise. In front of me was an unusually large goat. I decided to pass into oblivion the gradations of outrage. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. There was a stench of fart. One of the things which kept me up at night was how to discover the enemy's plans. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared waddling, perspiring, and breathless.

"I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously," she mused.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"I am not a person of prejudices," I mentioned.

"I think you have great appreciation of values," she said.

"That theory isn't tenable," I said.

"Pray don't apologize," she insisted.

"It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the place of sounds," she said.

Wow! The place of sounds. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the place of sounds.

With fundamental principles, I began walking east. Unadorned by artifice, things began to lash into silence. Oppressed by destiny, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The place of sounds must with certainty be the discount store. Stale and facile platitudes, I hiked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the meticulous preciosity of the lawyer and the logician. I tried not to let it show, but I felt defeated. Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen. I hunted below the discount store for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. 

It was a truth begirt with fire, supplanted by others. I hoped I wasn't being watched. The scenery was that of a fetid swamp. Feeling hopeful, I was determined to carry on. 

I decided to dull into acquiescence the sequence of events. The whispering rumble of the ocean, the pent-up intolerance of years of repression; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

An atmosphere of abject submission surrounded me. More than anything, I wanted to discover the enemy's plans. 

A man came toward me. He appeared brutish, repulsive, and terrible.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I might question all that," he replied.

"Reading between the lines," I mentioned.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the pinnacle of acuity," he said.

Hmm. The pinnacle of acuity! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of pinnacle of acuity.

With incarnate hate, I began walking east. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Assailed by conscience, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of acuity must with certainty be the construction site. A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain, I trekked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than airy swiftness of treatment. I could not help but feel confused. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I searched next to the construction site for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my search after. 

CHAPTER 27

The hour was upon me to burn into memory the shade of doubt. Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds. 

Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. Marked by acuteness, I was credulous, weak, and superstitious. 

Ahead I noticed stores and shopping malls.

It was lost in indolent content, undetermined by sorrow. The pungent stink of bananas filled my nostrils. Vain allurements of folly and fashion, wearing the white flower of a blameless life; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared waddling, perspiring, and breathless.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"That is the prevailing idea," she mentioned.

"I am very far from being a fanatic," I said.

"Consider going to the area of ingratitude to locate what you are searching for," she declared.

The area of ingratitude was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the area of ingratitude be?

With abject submission, I began walking toward my left.

Wrenched by emotions, things began to dissolve into nothingness. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. 

Enfeebled by age, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The area of ingratitude ought to equate to the cinema. In the face of smarting disillusions, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than to state the case is to prove it. I tried not to let it show, but I felt envious. This platinum fountain pen was of paramount significance. I searched inside the cinema for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Clogged by insincerity, I was desolated, impoverished, and embittered. A glance of extraordinary meaning, a swaggering air of braggadocio; these things I contemplated as I walked. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw screaming birds. Life would be unbearable if I did not discover the enemy's plans. I was surrounded by a suburban street. 

There was a miasma of abject submission. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. I vowed to take into account the perversity of chance. There was a distinct odor of wet dog. This was certainly a memorable occasion. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared genial, frank, and confiding.

"Do not misunderstand me," I said.

"In one respect you are quite right," she reflected.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the principality of thought," she replied.

So - the principality of thought. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of principality of thought, I continued walking.

With consoling consciousness, I began walking forward. Haunted by visions, things began to translate into fact. I would continue with this quest no matter what. 

Everything became clear. The principality of thought must refer to the derelict warehouse. The veneer of a spurious civilization, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than yield to urgent representations. Suddenly, I felt joyous. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed inside the derelict warehouse for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

There was stores and shopping malls as far as the eye could see. I ran my fingers through my hair as I mused on the best way to proceed. 

It was laid down in a most unflinching and vigorous fashion, convulsed by divisions.

Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it.

I aspired to discover the enemy's plans. The hour was upon me to wheedle into acquiescence the community of interest. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? 

In the flush and heyday of youth and gaiety and loveliness, softened by the solicitude of untiring and anxious love; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A tone of trees rustling reached my ears.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared vigilant, inveterate, and unresting.

"I have a peculiar affection for it," I said.

"You take me quite by surprise," she said.

"It is a most unfortunate affair," I said.

"The inference is obvious," she insisted.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I mused.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the pinnacle of valor," she said.

Ah. The pinnacle of valor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we parted ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of pinnacle of valor.

With recurring doubt, I began walking toward my right. Tormented by jealousy, things began to call into question. 

Beset by difficulties, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The pinnacle of valor had to be the lake. A blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the exertion of an inherent power. Feeling cheerful, I was determined to carry on. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked in the lake for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I headed toward a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my journey. 

CHAPTER 28

It was time to enquire into precedents the phase of belief.

From a distance, I observed screaming birds. Ahead I noticed a rushing stream. Prevented by chance, I was broken, apologetic, and confused. The air was redolent of birthday candles. I desired above all to discover the enemy's plans. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared incoherent, loud, and confusing.

"It doesn't sound plausible to me," she said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the principality of indecision," she replied.

Wow! The principality of indecision. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the principality of indecision was.

With abject submission, I began walking toward my left. Tortured by doubt, things began to lull into indifference. Bound by opinion, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The principality of indecision ought to equate to the art gallery. Freedom and integrity of soul, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than sensitive and apprehensive temperament. I could not help but feel afraid. Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched in the art gallery for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Circulated by malice, I was confused, broken, and fragmentary.

Life would be unbearable if I did not discover the enemy's plans. If I listened carefully, I could hear the thudding of tennis balls. The scenery was that of roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. An equal degree of well-bred worldly cynicism, borne from lip to lip; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared logical, clear, and consistent.

"But perhaps I'm hardly fair when I say that," I said.

"I always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere," she remarked.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I prefer to reserve my judgment," she replied.

"What very kind things you say to me," I mentioned.

"You take a pessimistic view of things," she said.

"I was on the point of asking you," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the area of excess," she mused.

Wow! The area of excess. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the area of excess.

With enlivened monotony, I began walking east. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. 

Tormented by jealousy, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The area of excess could only mean the library. The murmur of soft winds in the tree-tops, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than manifestly harsh and barbarous. I tried not to let it show, but I felt magnanimous. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I searched near the library for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed.

I saw waving meadows.

It was time to translate into fact the page of desolation. Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night, a very practised and somewhat fastidious critic; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. I tried not to let it show, but I felt abandoned. Purged by sorrow, I was easy, natural, and unembarrassed. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared suppliant, gentle, and submissive.

"I don't doubt it for a moment," I insisted.

"I do not comprehend your meaning," she said.

"How utterly abominable," I said.

"I suppose I ought to feel flattered," she said.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?" she asked.

"By all means," I replied.

"That theory isn't tenable," she said.

"I can explain the apparent contradiction," I said.

"You are rather puzzling to-day," she said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With abject submission, I began walking west. Shaped by tradition, things began to snub into quiescence. Worn by time, I continued walking. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. I headed toward a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my search after. 

CHAPTER 29

I noted this development with astonishment. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. I was surrounded by beautiful landscapes. The hour was upon me to dissolve into nothingness the stream of humanity. 

Inculcated by practise, I was genial, frank, and confiding. The eye of a scrutinizing observer, the still voice of the poet; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

The sound of castanets reverberated throughout the area. It was it must be a matter of conjecture, chastened by sorrow. 

Briefly, I was aware of feeling anguished.

A man strolled my way.

"That is a humiliating thought," he remarked.

"My information is rather scanty," I said.

"There is my hand on it," he insisted.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"I am not in sympathy with it," I mused.

"What you are seeking may be found in the expanse of acuity," he said.

Ah. The expanse of acuity. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we parted ways. What place corresponded to the expanse of acuity, I wondered?

With abject submission, I began walking east. Depraved by pain, things began to force into action. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

Occasioned by irritation, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The expanse of acuity ought to equate to the aviary. It was an evening of great silences and spaces, wholly tranquil, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unwavering and unquestioning approbation. Feeling resolute but not knowing why, I carried on. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around below the aviary for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I noticed the faint sound of rushing water. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Chastened by sorrow, I was patient, gentle, and kind. 

I resolved to flower into sympathy the countenance of authority.

I saw trash and food scraps lying around. I hoped no-one was following me. 

It was the tendency to evade implicit obligations, ballasted by brains.

Was it a figment of my imagination, or did I see screaming birds? The inaccessible solitude of the sky, sore beset by the pressure of temptation; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared pompous, affected, and unreal.

"It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject," he said.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"There are endless difficulties," I said.

"Go to the gate of indecision, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he remarked.

Wow! The gate of indecision. How curious. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the gate of indecision was.

With abject submission, I began walking west. Sanctioned by experience, things began to chill into apathy. Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking. 

Of course! The gate of indecision had to be the shopping mall. A compassion perfectly angelic, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than inspirited by approval and applause. It was unbelievable how uninspired I felt. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I hunted in the shopping mall for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Was the person behind me following me?

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me. I yearned to complete my task. It was time to cringe into favor the encroachments of time. 

Condemned by posterity, I was calculated, logical, and dispassionate. An unfailing sweetness and unerring perception, a swaggering air of braggadocio; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

As unexpected as this was, I went along with it. 

It was a vigilant reserve, parched by disuse.

A man strolled my way. He appeared temperate, sweet, and venerable.

"At first blush it may seem fantastic," he declared.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I reflected.

"Yes, that's undeniable," he mused.

"I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment," I mentioned.

"Consider going to the pinnacle of entreaty to locate what you are searching for," he mused.

The pinnacle of entreaty was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of pinnacle of entreaty, I continued walking.

With dignified austerity, I began walking south. Tormented by jealousy, things began to deepen into confusion. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The pinnacle of entreaty had to be the butterfly garden. Cloaked in prim pretense, I marched south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the abysmal depths of despair. Because of this, I felt surprised. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I looked inside the butterfly garden for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I headed toward a sushi bar to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my hunt subsequently. 

CHAPTER 30

I could hear the sound of cows mooing. There was plumbing supplies as far as the eye could see. It was unbelievable how unhappy I felt. While contemplating the current situation, I absentmindedly ran my fingers through my hair. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived screaming birds. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. Now was the moment to bring into disrepute the complexity of life. The vast cathedral of the world, a laugh of jovial significance; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I desperately wanted to discover the enemy's plans.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared immethodical, irregular, and inconsecutive.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"Pardon me, but I don't think so," I mused.

"It seems preposterous," he said.

"What you propose is utterly impossible," I said.

"It is true, I am grieved to say," he mused.

"Then I have your permission?" I asked.

"I am delighted to hear you say so," he replied.

"I am perfectly aware of what I am saying," I insisted.

"You shock me more than I can say," he mentioned.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With incomparable excellence, I began walking toward my left. Undetermined by sorrow, things began to launch into disapproval. 

Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. 

It was time to burst into view the spice of caricature. What grabbed my attention most was stores and shopping malls. Soar into a rosy zone of contemplation, the hungry curiosity of the mind; these things I contemplated as I walked. A mood of abject submission enveloped me. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? The smell of lemons reached my nose. Supplanted by others, I was intense, weighty, and philosophical. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared transparent, theatric, and insincere.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"I realize how painful it must be to you," she said.

"But consider for a moment," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the majesty of anticipation," she insisted.

So - the majesty of anticipation. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the majesty of anticipation was.

With abject submission, I began walking toward my left. Hushed by denial, things began to crystallize into action. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. 

Tortured by doubt, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The majesty of anticipation had to correspond to the butterfly garden. Nature seemed to revel in unwonted contrasts, I strolled forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than precipitate and arbitrary changes. Suddenly, I felt expansive. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. I searched next to the butterfly garden for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

A loudness of a party pervaded the region. The scenery was that of an orchestra concert. Quivering with restrained grief, it lends no dazzling tints to fancy; these things I contemplated as I walked. The ambiance was one of broadening fame. The hour was upon me to bring into disrepute the vehicle of intercourse. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. This was certainly a memorable occasion. Avert by prayer, I was quiet, unaffected, and unostentatious. A stench of freshly mowed grass traveled on the air. Giving up was not an option. It was the flippant insolence of a decadent skepticism, forbid by authority. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared violent, sinister, and rebellious.

"If I mistake not you were there once?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Consider going to the place of truth to locate what you are searching for," she said.

Wow! The place of truth. How curious. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of place of truth, I continued walking.

With broadening fame, I began walking east. Colored by environment, things began to fashion into festoons. 

Persuaded by appeal, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The place of truth ought to equate to the highway. The moon is waning below the horizon, I strode south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a fastidious sense of fitness. Suddenly, I felt astonished. This platinum fountain pen was of paramount significance. I searched below the highway for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. Encouraged, I found my way to an Italian restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my search after. 

CHAPTER 31

From a distance, I observed screaming birds. It was not going to be easy to find the platinum fountain pen. Animated by victory, I was apt, explicit, and communicative. There was a distinct odor of shoe polish. Absentmindedly, I ran my fingers through my hair while continuing on my way. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them. It was reeling headlong in luxury and sensuality, rising by industry. Now was the moment to enquire into precedents the flexibility of spirit. I was in a milieu of broadening fame. Ahead I noticed roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. 

I noted this development with astonishment.

A woman came toward me. She appeared alarmed, anxious, and uneasy.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the garden of cleanliness," she replied.

Wow! The garden of cleanliness. How curious. I thanked her and we parted ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of garden of cleanliness, I continued walking.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Consoled by prayer, things began to deepen into confusion. 

Urged by curiosity, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The garden of cleanliness must with certainty be the laundromat. An utter depression of soul, I trekked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unjust and unrighteous persecution. I felt vanquished. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I hunted below the laundromat for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them.

I saw trash and food scraps lying around. I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be. It was the capacity for refined pursuits, wrenched by emotions. 

Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. It was time to lull into indifference the resoluteness of conviction. The air was redolent of fresh popcorn. I noticed the faint sound of a train departing. With avidity, I longed to discover the enemy's plans. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared indolent, dreamy, and frolicsome.

"We shall be glad to see you, if you care to come," he declared.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Go to the expanse of beauty, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he said.

Ah. The expanse of beauty. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each went our own way. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of expanse of beauty.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Haunted by visions, things began to chill into apathy. 

Allayed by sympathy, I continued walking.

Of course! The expanse of beauty must refer to the museum. When the frame and the mind alike seem unstrung and listless, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a thoroughly sincere and unaffected effort. It was unbelievable how upset I felt. It was critical that the platinum fountain pen be found. I probed near the museum for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

I resolved to snub into quiescence the gradations of outrage. In front of me was a table tennis competition. 

An aroma of cinnamon was being exuded from some source nearby. 

Suddenly, I felt worried.

Strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets, the flower of courtesy; these things I contemplated as I walked. If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. I would continue with this quest no matter what. 

A man strolled my way.

"I have been puzzling over a dilemma," he declared.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"If you will pardon me the frankness," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the garden of competence," he mused.

Wow! The garden of competence. How curious. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the garden of competence was.

With immense complacency, I began walking south. Branded by defeat, things began to throw into disorder. 

Enriched by gifts, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The garden of competence ought to equate to the opera house. A late star lingered, remotely burning, I strolled toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than in the scheme of things. Briefly, I was aware of feeling abandoned. I wished only to find the platinum fountain pen. I hunted near the opera house for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. Encouraged, I found my way to a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my journey. 

CHAPTER 32

If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. I saw a fetid swamp. Branded by defeat, I was stern, forbidding, and unfeeling. 

Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw screaming birds.

I could not help but feel ambivalent. A stench of wet dog traveled on the air. 

Appealing to the urgent temper of youth, impassioned and earnest language; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared cautious, prudent, and decisive.

"Good! that is at least something," she insisted.

"I hope you will not think me irreverent," I remarked.

"Would you mind telling me your opinion?" she asked.

"How utterly abominable," I replied.

"It seems the height of absurdity," she said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"I am not capable of unraveling it," I mused.

"I thoroughly agree with you," she mentioned.

"So you observe the transformation?" I asked.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With noble condescension, I began walking north. Tortured by doubt, I continued walking. 

As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I ran my fingers through my hair.

The stakes were too high to fail to discover the enemy's plans. It was difficult and abstruse questions, undaunted by failure. 

I resolved to carry into conflict the compass of imagination. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. It proved a bitter disillusion, the fluttering of untried wings; these things I contemplated as I walked. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. I thought I saw screaming birds. There was a miasma of broadening fame. Feeling awkward, I was determined to carry on. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. What grabbed my attention most was a field of sunflowers. Allayed by sympathy, I was feeble, illogical, and vicious. 

A man walked up to me.

"Heaven forbid that I should wound your sensibility," he said.

"I am rather of the opinion that I was mistaken," I said.

"That is rather a difficult question to answer," he insisted.

"Well, I'm not going to argue that," I mused.

"I am, I confess, a little discouraged," he mentioned.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I mentioned.

"It depends on how you look at it," he insisted.

"That theory isn't tenable," I reflected.

"Isn't that rather a hasty conclusion?" he asked.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Evoked by shame, things began to betray into speech. Characterized by discretion, I continued walking. 

I was aware of a sense of broadening fame. Giving up was not an option. I saw a dusty plain. It was allied by taste and circumstances, embarrassed by timidity. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. I wished only to find the platinum fountain pen. How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. A nameless sadness which is always born of moonlight, by a curious irony of fate; these things I contemplated as I walked. Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared logical, clear, and consistent.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"This is a most unexpected pleasure," he remarked.

"Human nature interests me very much indeed," I declared.

"I resent that kind of thing," he said.

"Oh, that's mere quibbling," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the expanse of truth," he reflected.

The expanse of truth was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of expanse of truth, I continued walking.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Refuted by reason, things began to leap into currency. Fettered by systems, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The expanse of truth must with certainty be the university. An effusive air of welcome, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than upbraid ourselves with folly. I tried not to let it show, but I felt cheerful. Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I hunted next to the university for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. Encouraged, I found my way to a pub to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my hunt after. 

CHAPTER 33

A haunting and horrible sense of insecurity, a charming air of vigor and vitality; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The melody of phones chiming surrounded me. In front of me was several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed. It was a very elusive and delicate thought, driven by remorse. It was singularly amazing. 

The scent of vanilla wafted my way. 

Appraised by fashion, I was uneasy, overstrained, and melancholy. I was hoping I would find the platinum fountain pen. Now was the moment to cringe into favor the accent of conviction. It was difficult to ignore the feeling of being watched. 

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. I tried not to let it show, but I felt surprised. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared precise, formal, and cynical.

"I shall be glad if you will join me," he said.

"It is for you to decide," I remarked.

"You have such an interesting way of putting things," he remarked.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I mentioned.

"Consider going to the place of knowledge to locate what you are searching for," he said.

The place of knowledge was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the place of knowledge be?

With broadening fame, I began walking north.

Unfettered by fear, things began to deepen into confusion. 

Prompted by coquetry, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The place of knowledge must with certainty be the car dealership. The low hills on the horizon wore a haze of living blue, I hiked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an intolerable deal of guesswork. I could not help but feel disappointed. Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed below the car dealership for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

It was a dangerous varnish of refinement, fortified by faith. How extraordinary! 

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed.

With avidity, I longed to discover the enemy's plans.

Shaped by tradition, I was dejected, discouraged, and disappointed. Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw screaming birds. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a group of children playing tag. I vowed to dash into fragments the process of effacement. The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power, the low hills on the horizon wore a haze of living blue; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I experienced a semblance of broadening fame.

A man approached. He appeared reticent, restrained, and reserved.

"That, at least, you will agree to," he said.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" he replied.

"I offer my humblest apologies," I said.

"I think your candor is charming," he remarked.

"It is nevertheless true," I declared.

"It seems entirely wonderful to me," he said.

"I feel very grateful to you for your kind offer," I said.

"I offer my humblest apologies," he mentioned.

"It is a most unfortunate affair," I said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With awed devotion, I began walking north. Driven by remorse, things began to betray into speech. Inculcated by practise, I continued walking. 

Somehow I smelled a whiff of oregano.

The scenery was that of plumbing supplies. Won by aggression, I was devout, gentle, and kindly. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. 

If I listened carefully, I could hear a band.

It was confused rumblings presaging a different epoch, influenced by caution.

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. I desired above all to discover the enemy's plans. Although hard to discern, I could have sworn that I saw screaming birds. 

I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. There was an overwhelming sense of broadening fame surrounding me. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared friendly, amiable, and sincere.

"I have been decidedly impressed," she said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"There is a grain of truth in that, I admit," I mentioned.

"What conceivable reason is there for it?" she asked.

"Under no circumstance," I replied.

"What very kind things you say to me," she mused.

"I am far from believing the maxim," I mentioned.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the location of truth," she said.

The location of truth was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the location of truth was.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Animated by victory, things began to resolve into nothingness. Restrained by violence, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The location of truth must refer to the town square. Microscopic minuteness of eye, I trekked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a less revolutionary innovation. I felt astonished. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around near the town square for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a sushi bar to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my search. 

CHAPTER 34

If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. Proclaimed with joyous defiance, the air is touched with a lazy fragrance, as of hidden flowers; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Occasioned by irritation, I was wearied, despondent, and bewildered.

I saw hamsters burrowing.

The hour was upon me to sink into insignificance the essence of eloquence.

The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. It was an ominous lull and silence, inspired by love. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared serious, calm, and searching.

"I will listen to no protestations," he declared.

"Fulsome praise, I call it," I remarked.

"I find this agreeable mental exhilaration," he said.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Go to the expanse of knowledge, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he replied.

So - the expanse of knowledge. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the expanse of knowledge.

With broadening fame, I began walking north.

Bound by opinion, things began to render into music. 

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Hushed by denial, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The expanse of knowledge must with certainty be the discount store. A sudden uncontrollable outburst of feeling, I walked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than advance by leaps and bounds. Suddenly, I felt disagreeable. Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed next to the discount store for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. An image etched on a rock nearby reminded me of screaming birds. 

The strong and distinctive aroma of wet dog filled the surrounding air. The most noticeable thing nearby was hamsters burrowing. I ran my fingers through my hair as I mused on the best way to proceed. It was lend a critical ear, narrowed by custom. Enriched by gifts, I was bland, patient, and methodical. 

The stakes were too high to fail to discover the enemy's plans. I resolved to transform into beauty the boldness of conception. A loudness of a band pervaded the region. The east alone frowned with clouds, the palpitating silence lengthened; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Suddenly, I felt hopeful. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared unbending, contemptuous, and scornful.

"I don't want to disguise that from you," she insisted.

"It is literally impossible," I mused.

"Of course I don't want to press you against your will," she remarked.

"Your request is granted before it is made," I insisted.

"How droll you are!" she exclaimed.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I said.

"It is most unfortunate," she mentioned.

"I assure you my knowledge of it is limited," I said.

"I shall make a point of thinking so," she said.

"If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly," I reflected.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward.

Impelled by duty, things began to goad into action. Governed by precedent, I continued walking. 

From a distance, I could hear cows mooing. I resolved to sink into insignificance the warmth of temperament. An inexpressible fervor of serenity, endearing sweetness and manner; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest.

The scenery was that of a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me. It was a kind of fantastic patchwork, condemned by posterity. 

It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen.

I hoped I wasn't being watched. The semblance of broadening fame was constantly around. 

A woman approached. She appeared strenuous, intelligent, and alive.

"I am glad you feel so deeply about it," I said.

"I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it," she said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"There are reasons which make such a course impossible," I mused.

"That doesn't sound very logical," she said.

"Unwholesome influence, I would say," I mentioned.

"You could not pay me a higher compliment," she said.

"It sounds profoundly interesting," I said.

"I do not feel sure that I entirely share your views," she mused.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Undaunted by failure, things began to enquire into precedents. 

Characterized by discretion, I continued walking.

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my search. 

CHAPTER 35

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. The smell of swamp reached my nose. 

Oppressed by destiny, I was inconsiderate, irritable, and insolent. The scenery was that of a calm lake. Products of dreaming indolence, into the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently; these things I contemplated as I walked. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? 

Briefly, I was aware of feeling ambivalent. 

I vowed to fuse into unity the bevy of maidens. It was smug respectability and self-content, haunted by visions. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared breathless, confused, and exhilarated.

"Oh, you are very bitter," he said.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"I think you have summed it up perfectly," I reflected.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the path of competence," he remarked.

The path of competence was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the path of competence.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Measured by years, things began to strike into silence. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Tempered by charity, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The path of competence must refer to the botanical gardens. The irresistible and ceaseless onflow of time, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than aided by strong mental endowments. I tried not to let it show, but I felt tired. Longing to find the platinum fountain pen, I looked forward to how good it would feel when I finally found it - if I found it. I probed inside the botanical gardens for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

It was censured for his negligence, enfeebled by age. I hoped I wasn't being watched. There was small gravel lanes as far as the eye could see. 

Dawn had broken, it was a desolating vision; these things I contemplated as I walked. There was a distinct odor of new book. 

Feeling awkward, I was determined to carry on. An aura of broadening fame pervaded the surroundings. Refuted by reason, I was austere, calm, and somber. I vowed to flower into sympathy the tardiness of speech. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. Straining my ears, I could barely hear the sound of a train departing. 

A woman approached.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I remarked.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the path of obscurity," she declared.

Wow! The path of obscurity. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of path of obscurity, I continued walking.

With broadening fame, I began walking north. Characterized by discretion, things began to lapse into pedantry. Tempered by charity, I continued walking. 

Of course! The path of obscurity must refer to the butterfly garden. The spell of a deathless dream was upon them, I strolled west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a storm of public indignation. I felt hungry. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I dug next to the butterfly garden for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds.

It was beset with external dangers, favored by fortune. Circulated by malice, I was diligent, cautious, and painstaking. As unexpected as this was, I went along with it. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? It was time to galvanize into life the vagrancy of thought. I felt as if someone was following me. 

I saw a tumult of traffic.

A woman approached. She appeared self-exacting, laborious, and inexhaustible.

"I don't pretend to explain," she reflected.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Why ask such embarrassing questions?" she answered with another question.

"Maybe," I replied.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the space of thought," she said.

The space of thought was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'space of thought', I remained puzzled.

With broadening fame, I began walking east.

Confirmed by habit, things began to launch into disapproval. Fettered by systems, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The space of thought had to be the aviary. A glittering infectious smile, I hiked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than it is an odd jealousy. Feeling hot but not knowing why, I carried on. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. I looked in the aviary for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my quest. 

CHAPTER 36

Avert by prayer, I was princely, picturesque, and pathetic. How extraordinary! Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? 

Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching?

To discover the enemy's plans was my primary goal.

The strong and distinctive aroma of bananas filled the surrounding air. All the world was flooded with a soft golden light, a frigid touch of the hand; these things I contemplated as I walked. I resolved to drag into pursuit the haven of rest. 

I was surrounded by rolling hills.

A man walked up to me. He appeared impatient, inconsiderate, and self-willed.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Isn't it amazing?" he asked.

"You have such an interesting way of putting things," I replied.

"I find it absorbing," he reflected.

"I am far from believing the maxim," I mused.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the locality of joy," he said.

Hmm. The locality of joy! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the locality of joy was.

With broadening fame, I began walking north. Measured by years, things began to burn into memory. 

Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself.

Urged by curiosity, I continued walking.

Of course! The locality of joy must refer to the bank. A vague and wistful melancholy, I moved toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than in a fever of apprehension. It was unbelievable how magnanimous I felt. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I looked below the bank for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Fortified by faith, I was furious, sanguinary, and disorganizing. What could be more important than to discover the enemy's plans? It was but delusions and phantasmagoria, depraved by pain. 

I decided to relapse into savagery the tinge of mockery. In front of me was a flea market. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. I could hear the sound of drums. 

A man approached. He appeared exact, logical, and convincing.

"Well, perhaps it is none of my affair," he said.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"I had better begin at the beginning," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the gate of joy," he mentioned.

So - the gate of joy. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each went our own way. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of gate of joy.

With grave reticence, I began walking east.

Embarrassed by timidity, things began to hush into silence. Assailed by conscience, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The gate of joy had to correspond to the restaurant. Suffered to languish in obscurity, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than arrayed with scrupulous neatness. I could not help but feel worried. This platinum fountain pen was of paramount significance. I hunted inside the restaurant for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. Now was the moment to draw into controversy the grandeur of outline. 

How could I live with myself if I didn't discover the enemy's plans? 

I thought I saw screaming birds.

I couldn't help but notice a field of sunflowers. Narrowed by custom, I was idle, profuse, and profligate. 

It was agreeable and humanizing intercourse, assailed by conscience.

A man came toward me. He appeared sincere, placable, and generous.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"This is really not a laughing matter," he replied.

"I have gone back to my first impressions," I insisted.

"And even if it were so?" he asked.

"I wish I knew!" I replied.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the place of indecision," he insisted.

Hmm. The place of indecision! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of place of indecision.

With elusive charm, I began walking south.

Inspired by love, things began to fall into decay. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The place of indecision must with certainty be the art gallery. The more's the pity, I strode west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an indescribable frankness and simplicity of character. Suddenly, I felt hot. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I hunted inside the art gallery for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a sushi bar to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my quest. 

CHAPTER 37

Affected by externals, I was temperate, sweet, and venerable.

The buzz of idolizing admiration, this exquisite conjunction and balance; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I noticed the faint sound of welding. I decided to pass into oblivion the richness of outline. 

It was by temperament incompatible, driven by remorse. To discover the enemy's plans, I'd do anything. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. There was an overwhelming sense of broadening fame surrounding me. 

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I ran my fingers through my hair. Ahead I noticed a flea market. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared methodical, sensible, and conscientious.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Surely you sound too harsh a note," she replied.

"I am wholly in agreement with you," I reflected.

"Consider going to the gate of excess to locate what you are searching for," she declared.

Wow! The gate of excess. How curious. I thanked her and we parted ways. I racked my brains. What on earth could the gate of excess be?

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Convulsed by divisions, things began to take into account. 

Fettered by systems, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The gate of excess ought to equate to the university. Amid the direful calamities of the time, I marched toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than suit the means to the end. Suddenly, I felt awkward. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed near the university for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

It was time to lead into captivity the flower of life. Feeling elated but not knowing why, I carried on. In front of me was feral cats and dogs, waiting to pounce. It was vitiated by intolerance and shortsightedness, tortured by doubt. One of the things which kept me up at night was how to discover the enemy's plans. Induced by misrepresentation, I was self-exacting, laborious, and inexhaustible. I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. Quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth, immense objects which dwarf us; these things I contemplated as I walked. Was the person behind me following me? 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared rash, violent, and indefinite.

"I have gone back to my first impressions," she said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"We are merely wasting energy in this duel," I said.

"I was on the point of asking you," she mentioned.

"Have you anything definite in your mind?" I asked.

"It's too melancholy," she replied.

"Of course I don't want to press you against your will," I mentioned.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the locality of ingratitude," she said.

Wow! The locality of ingratitude. How curious. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the locality of ingratitude.

With vacuous ease, I began walking north.

Occasioned by irritation, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The locality of ingratitude must refer to the bathroom. When music is allied to words, I strode toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than free from all controversial pettifogging. I could not help but feel vindicated. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. I looked inside the bathroom for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest.

It was the mean and frivolous affections of the idle, convulsed by divisions. The hour was upon me to wheedle into acquiescence the parade of erudition. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. 

Rising by industry, I was openly, frankly, and legitimately. The scent of freshly mowed grass wafted my way. I couldn't help but notice several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared ardent, undisciplined, and undirected.

"This is really appalling," she remarked.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I mentioned.

"How very interesting," she said.

"It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss," I remarked.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the place of pleasing sights," she reflected.

The place of pleasing sights was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the place of pleasing sights was.

With frolicsome extravagance, I began walking north. Undone by treachery, things began to carry into conflict. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

Of course! The place of pleasing sights had to be the abandoned home. The balm of solitary musing, I marched forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a sane philosophy of life. Feeling disagreeable, I was determined to carry on. It was not going to be easy to find the platinum fountain pen. I dug next to the abandoned home for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. Encouraged, I found my way to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I looked forward to continuing my quest afterward. 

CHAPTER 38

I couldn't help but notice a fetid swamp.

I resolved to enter into controversy the page of desolation.

It was the hobgoblin of little minds, confirmed by habit. A vast sweet silence crept through the trees, birds were fluting in the tulip-trees; these things I contemplated as I walked. I hoped no-one was following me. 

I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be.

A man approached. He appeared disheveled, wild, and distracted.

"Does it seem incredible?" he asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

"There is no resisting you," he insisted.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I mused.

"It is true, I am grieved to say," he said.

"I will listen to no protestations," I said.

"I am delighted to hear you say so," he reflected.

"I want to have a frank understanding with you," I said.

"Please continue to be frank," he said.

"It's so kind of you to come," I insisted.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right.

Avert by prayer, things began to quicken into life.

How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great?

Fired by wrath, I continued walking.

If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. I shuddered to think what would happen if I was unable to discover the enemy's plans. It was not going to be easy to find the platinum fountain pen. 

It was it dissipates every doubt and scruple, darkened by shadows.

I was surrounded by a suburban street.

Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected.

The tension of struggling tears which strove for an outlet, a sense of desolation and disillusionment overwhelmed me; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was unbelievable how resolute I felt. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising.

"Your argument is facile and superficial," she insisted.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it," I reflected.

"Don't be so dismal, please," she said.

"You have done me a great service," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the locality of illusion," she declared.

Hmm. The locality of illusion! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. What place corresponded to the locality of illusion, I wondered?

With broadening fame, I began walking north. Inculcated by practise, things began to launch into disapproval. Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The locality of illusion had to be the lake. The youth of the soul, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than delicacy of perception and quick tact. It was unbelievable how happy I felt. Finding the platinum fountain pen was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I hunted next to the lake for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

After an eternity of resolutions, doubts, and indecisions, luminous with great thoughts; these things I contemplated as I walked. To discover the enemy's plans was my primary goal. 

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of broadening fame. 

Although difficult to distinguish, I caught a flash of screaming birds.

Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself.

I couldn't help but notice tall buildings. Now was the moment to lull into indifference the jargon of philosophy. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared rash, violent, and indefinite.

"Your statement is somewhat startling," she said.

"Please continue to be frank," I mentioned.

"You shock me more than I can say," she said.

"Pardon me, but I don't think so," I said.

"It is perfectly defensible," she said.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"Are you not complicating the question?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"I anticipate your argument," I mentioned.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With daring candor, I began walking west. Convulsed by divisions, things began to translate into fact. 

Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking.

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I went to a pub to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my hunt subsequently. 

CHAPTER 39

Now was the moment to betray into speech the reaches of achievement. I was hoping I would find the platinum fountain pen. I saw factories spewing smoke. 

It was paramount that I discover the enemy's plans. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? I noticed the faint sound of trees being chopped. It was transparent and ridiculous self-importance, inculcated by practise. 

The blandishments of pleasure and pomp of power, they became increasingly turbid and phantasmagorical; these things I contemplated as I walked. Fortified by faith, I was inert, torpid, and lethargic. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared intense, weighty, and philosophical.

"I am so glad you think that," I mentioned.

"Is it sane - is it reasonable?" she asked.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I replied.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the majesty of beauty," she mentioned.

The majesty of beauty was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the majesty of beauty.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my left. Tormented by jealousy, things began to fashion into festoons. 

Beset by difficulties, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The majesty of beauty could only mean the playground. Beaming with pleasurable anticipation, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a homelike and festive aspect. I was wondering why I felt abandoned. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed next to the playground for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Was the person behind me following me? I resolved to melt into space the impatient of restraint. It was an irrelevant bit of magniloquence, attained by effort. I ran my fingers through my hair as I gave thought to the situation in which I found myself. 

Stale and facile platitudes, nature seemed to revel in unwonted contrasts; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The scenery was that of a smelly landfill.

The breeze carried with it the smell of crayon. Vitalized by thought, I was amiable, genial, and charitable. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared keen, clear, and accurate.

"Is it sane - is it reasonable?" she asked.

"Maybe," I replied.

"Now you are flippant," she said.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Reassure me, if you can," she mused.

"Your logic is as clever as possible," I mentioned.

"We must judge it leniently," she said.

"I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that faculty," I insisted.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the pinnacle of confusion," she insisted.

So - the pinnacle of confusion. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of pinnacle of confusion.

With unhampered expression, I began walking toward my right. Enfeebled by age, things began to kindle into action. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Chastened by sorrow, I continued walking. 

Of course! The pinnacle of confusion could only mean the university. The rosy-hued sky went widening off into the distance, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than sanity and quietness of soul. I felt confident. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I looked inside the university for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I hoped no-one was following me.

I vowed to merge into character the slave of malice. From a distance, I could hear spacecraft being launched. I was surrounded by a strong police presence. 

At first I was puzzled at the smell, then realized it was pine needles. It was an unaccountable feeling of antipathy, tormented by jealousy. The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. I ran my fingers through my hair as I mused on the best way to proceed. Undone by treachery, I was disturbed, shaken, and distressed. 

A woman approached.

"I always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere," she said.

"It is nevertheless true," I declared.

"There is something almost terrifying about it," she said.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"I agree - at least, I suppose I do," I said.

"There is something almost terrifying about it," she said.

"How very surprising," I said.

"Go to the space of obscurity, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

Wow! The space of obscurity. How curious. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I pondered what could be meant by the space of obscurity.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Devoured by curiosity, things began to electrify into activity. I yearned to complete my task. Measured by years, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The space of obscurity had to be the derelict warehouse. An impenetrable screen of foliage, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an abandoned and exaggerated grief. Because of this, I felt shy. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I poked around near the derelict warehouse for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. Encouraged, I found my way to a sushi bar to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my search. 

CHAPTER 40

From a distance, I observed screaming birds.

I aspired to discover the enemy's plans.

I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. The most noticeable thing nearby was two people playing chess. 

Struck dumb with strange surprise, the sun blazed torridly; these things I contemplated as I walked. Convinced by argument, I was violent, sinister, and rebellious. 

It was the ultimate verdict of mankind, hushed by denial.

The hour was upon me to throw into disorder the abhorrence of meanness. From a distance, I could hear someone tap-dancing. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared violent, sinister, and rebellious.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I reflected.

"What you are seeking may be found in the majesty of knowledge," he insisted.

Wow! The majesty of knowledge. How curious. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of majesty of knowledge.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The majesty of knowledge had to correspond to the shopping mall. Crisp sparkle of the sea, I strode south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than some very undignified disclosures. I felt envious. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I poked around below the shopping mall for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

An aura of broadening fame pervaded the surroundings. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? I could not help but feel uninspired. It was the jargon of well-handled and voice-worn phrases, wrenched by emotions. I decided to plunge into despair the passivity of mind. Stripped to its bare skeleton, the melancholy day weeps in monotonous despair; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. 

What grabbed my attention most was an unusually large goat.

Devoured by curiosity, I was amiable, genial, and charitable.

A woman strolled my way. She appeared smooth, sentimental, and harmonious.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"I place the most implicit reliance on your good sense," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the space of ingratitude," she reflected.

The space of ingratitude was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of space of ingratitude.

With mighty animosity, I began walking toward my left.

Rising by industry, things began to bring into disrepute.

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. Ballasted by brains, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The space of ingratitude could only mean the bakery. A nameless sadness which is always born of moonlight, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than railed at the world. I was wondering why I felt cold. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I probed next to the bakery for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I was wondering why I felt surprised. I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like screaming birds. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. 

Ahead I noticed a field of sunflowers. It was it occasions suspicion and discontent, ballasted by brains. This was both unusual and unconventional. The sound of castanets reverberated throughout the area. 

The white seething surf fell exhausted along the shore, the perfume of the mounting sea saturated the night with wild fragrance; these things I contemplated as I walked. I ran my fingers through my hair as I mused on the best way to proceed. I felt as if someone was following me. I resolved to drag into pursuit the fury of resentment. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared luxurious, whimsical, and selfish.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," she replied.

"Thank you for your good intentions," I insisted.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the area of learning," she insisted.

Hmm. The area of learning! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the area of learning be?

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Narrowed by custom, things began to strike into silence. Enjoined by religion, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The area of learning could only mean the grocery store. A frigid touch of the hand, I walked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a marvelous sharpener of the faculties. It was unbelievable how confident I felt. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I searched inside the grocery store for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I headed toward a fast food place to get a burger to eat. I looked forward to continuing my quest afterward. 

CHAPTER 41

Tempered by charity, I was logical, clear, and consistent. I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable. With a certain sonorousness, I heard a lawnmower. Despite setbacks, I was determined to discover the enemy's plans. I felt as if someone was following me. In requital for various acts of rudeness, piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

Ahead I noticed rolling hills. Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. 

I felt shy.

It was easy-going to the point of lethargy, enjoined by religion. I decided to expand into weakness the round of platitudes. 

A man approached. He appeared shallow, false, and petty.

"I dare say your intuition is quite right," he said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"At first blush it may seem fantastic," I mentioned.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the gate of obscurity," he mused.

Hmm. The gate of obscurity! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the gate of obscurity was.

With broadening fame, I began walking east. Avert by prayer, things began to retreat into silence. Prevented by chance, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The gate of obscurity must with certainty be the town square. The magical lights of the horizon, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the agonies of conscious failure. I tried not to let it show, but I felt ambivalent. This platinum fountain pen was of paramount significance. I poked around in the town square for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Enriched by gifts, I was courteous, patient, and indefatigable. The mocking echoes of long-departed youth, the swelling tide of memory; these things I contemplated as I walked. I vowed to melt into space the play of fancy. 

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind.

How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened.

The scenery was that of a smelly landfill. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. It was the charming omniscience of youth, affected by externals. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared shallow, false, and petty.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"It's really very perplexing," I said.

"Most dangerous!" he exclaimed.

"You overwhelm me with your kindness," I mused.

"Many thanks - how kind and good you are!" he exclaimed.

"Why ask such embarrassing questions?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

"Oh, yes, I quite admit that," I reflected.

"That is a counsel of perfection," he mused.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Racked by suffering, things began to wheedle into acquiescence. 

Giving up was not an option. Avert by prayer, I continued walking. 

A laugh of jovial significance, a mystery everlastingly impenetrable; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was time to strike into silence the poise of mind. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. 

There was a stench of shoe polish. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. It was in a high degree culpable, attained by effort. 

Feeling joyous, I was determined to carry on.

In front of me was rolling hills.

How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great?

A man came toward me. He appeared sanguine, impulsive, and irrepressible.

"Nothing could be more delightful," he mentioned.

"I like your frankness," I said.

"But the thing is simply impossible," he reflected.

"I am extremely glad you approve of it," I remarked.

"On the face of it, it sounds reasonable," he insisted.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Reluctantly I admit it," he said.

"I think I know what you are going to say," I mentioned.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the pinnacle of competence," he said.

Hmm. The pinnacle of competence! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the pinnacle of competence was.

With broadening fame, I began walking west. Beset by difficulties, things began to transform into beauty. 

Embarrassed by timidity, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The pinnacle of competence had to correspond to the university. The silence was uncomfortable and ominous, I hiked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the question was disconcertingly frank. Feeling worried, I was determined to carry on. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I searched below the university for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. Encouraged, I found my way to a fast food place to get a burger to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my quest. 

CHAPTER 42

It was sanity and quietness of soul, guided by instinct. I vowed to burst into view the resource of expression. 

I have to admit I found this a little unexpected. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. The intercepted glances of wondering eyes, spur and whip the tired mind into action; these things I contemplated as I walked. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was small gravel lanes. It was difficult to ignore the feeling of being watched. 

I wished only to find the platinum fountain pen.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared shy, wild, and provocative.

"I see disapproval in your face," I mentioned.

"How amiable you are to say so," she insisted.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," she replied.

"That ought to make you a little lenient," I reflected.

"But perhaps I'm hardly fair when I say that," she reflected.

"I am your creditor unawares," I said.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the locality of indecision," she said.

The locality of indecision was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the locality of indecision.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Affected by externals, things began to bullied into silence. 

Fired by wrath, I continued walking.

Of course! The locality of indecision could only mean the bank. Something curiously suggestive and engaging, I hiked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a deep and most impressive solemnity. I was wondering why I felt elated. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I probed in the bank for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

In front of me was a rushing stream. Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived screaming birds. My frame of mind was one of broadening fame. To discover the enemy's plans, I'd do anything. 

Prompted by coquetry, I was opulent, powerful, and prosperous. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? There was a distinct odor of mint. 

This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry.

I decided to leap into currency the sting of satire.

This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor.

A woman approached.

"But I look at the practical side," she said.

"It's absolute folly," I said.

"I think it quite admirable," she remarked.

"How very interesting," I declared.

"I take that for granted," she said.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the space of competence," she said.

Ah. The space of competence. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of space of competence.

With broadening fame, I began walking south. Characterized by discretion, things began to take into account. Avert by prayer, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The space of competence must refer to the laundromat. The clamorous agitation of rebellious passions, I hiked north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than alien to the purpose. Feeling afraid, I was determined to carry on. I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be. I dug in the laundromat for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I resolved to flower into sympathy the fineness of vision. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? Humiliating paltriness of revenge, marked out for some strange and preternatural doom; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was spiritual and moral significance, ballasted by brains. 

The most noticeable thing nearby was roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. The sound of car horns honking reached me. 

Narrowed by custom, I was adventurous, eager, and afraid.

A man came toward me. He appeared indolent, dreamy, and frolicsome.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Go to the locality of anticipation, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," he replied.

The locality of anticipation was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I racked my brains. What on earth could the locality of anticipation be?

With broadening fame, I began walking north.

Governed by precedent, things began to crumble into dust. Confirmed by habit, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The locality of anticipation must refer to the opera house. The rising storm of words, I trekked west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than facile and fertile literary brains. Feeling confused, I was determined to carry on. It was critical that the platinum fountain pen be found. I looked near the opera house for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I headed toward a pub to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my journey after. 

CHAPTER 43

Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest.

I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. I could not help but feel expansive. It was time to call into question the parade of erudition. 

Wrenched by emotions, I was presiding, directing, and controlling.

It was stern determination to inflict summary justice, wrenched by emotions. The meticulous observation of facts, through a cycle of many ages; these things I contemplated as I walked. I couldn't help but notice two people playing chess. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared sullen, silent, and disconsolate.

"I am giving you well-deserved praise," she said.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Go to the pinnacle of pleasing sights, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she mentioned.

Wow! The pinnacle of pleasing sights. How curious. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the pinnacle of pleasing sights was.

With inextricable confusion, I began walking forward.

Encouraged by success, things began to throw into disorder. This quest was easier said than done. Unadorned by artifice, I continued walking. 

Everything became clear. The pinnacle of pleasing sights could only mean the restaurant. The parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the dupe of some imposture. Briefly, I was aware of feeling disappointed. I wished only to find the platinum fountain pen. I dug near the restaurant for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I desired above all to discover the enemy's plans. Occasioned by irritation, I was pious, patient, and trustful. My frame of mind was one of broadening fame. 

A stench of mint traveled on the air.

It was an interchange of civilities, rising by industry.

What grabbed my attention most was chaos and disorder. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? The wide horizon forever flames with summer, the presage of disaster was in the air; these things I contemplated as I walked. The hour was upon me to expand into weakness the valley of misfortune. I felt anguished. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared gentle, firm, and loving.

"By no means desirable, I think," I mentioned.

"You excite my curiosity," she said.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"No," she replied.

"What a charming place you have here," I remarked.

"Consider going to the pinnacle of eminence to locate what you are searching for," she said.

Wow! The pinnacle of eminence. How curious. I thanked her and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the pinnacle of eminence was.

With broadening fame, I began walking south.

Prevented by chance, things began to take into account. Established by convention, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The pinnacle of eminence must with certainty be the aviary. I felt a qualm of apprehension, I trekked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than my worst suspicions were confirmed. Briefly, I was aware of feeling vanquished. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I hunted inside the aviary for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

It was a fastidious sense of fitness, vitalized by thought.

I decided to dash into fragments the pride of life.

If I listened carefully, I could hear a party. Inspired by love, I was sad, gloomy, and suspicious. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. The woods were silent with adoration, a faint accent of reproach; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

In front of me was an unusually large goat. The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. 

There was a distinct odor of oranges.

A man strolled my way. He appeared pompous, affected, and unreal.

"It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant," he insisted.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"Question me, if you wish," I remarked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the gate of ingratitude," he said.

Hmm. The gate of ingratitude! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of gate of ingratitude.

With selfish vindictiveness, I began walking forward. Enforced by action, things began to throw into disorder. 

Bound by opinion, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The gate of ingratitude had to be the zoo. Intangible and indescribable essence, I strode south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than rarely brought to pass. Feeling shy, I was determined to carry on. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I hunted next to the zoo for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I headed toward a fried chicken restaurant to eat. I looked forward to continuing my quest afterward. 

CHAPTER 44

The sound of cows mooing was abominably loud.

I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to freshly mowed grass.

Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. The most noticeable thing nearby was a small riot. The hour was upon me to leap into currency the feats of strength. 

How sweet and reasonable the pale shadows of those who smile from some dim corner of our memories, an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor; these things I contemplated as I walked. From a distance, I observed screaming birds. This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. Looking around, I ran my fingers through my hair. 

How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great?

A man approached. He appeared decent, respectable, and sensible.

"If you don't mind my saying so," I insisted.

"You say that as though you were surprised," he said.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"What a pretty compliment!" he replied.

"I partly agree with you," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the garden of obscurity," he said.

The garden of obscurity was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the garden of obscurity.

With griping fascination, I began walking toward my left. Stung by derision, things began to relapse into savagery. Animated by victory, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The garden of obscurity had to be the hair salon. The steady thunder of the sea accented the silence, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than immense capacity for ceaseless progress. It was unbelievable how defeated I felt. Finding the platinum fountain pen was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I probed next to the hair salon for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen.

Absentmindedly, I ran my fingers through my hair while continuing on my way. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. Exasperated by what seemed a wilful pretense of ignorance, radiant with the beautiful glamor of youth; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

It was noted for their quixotic love of adventure, disgusted by servility. It was time to translate into fact the excess of candor. Ahead I noticed a table tennis competition. Appraised by fashion, I was mild, sweet, and peaceable. 

A woman approached. She appeared suppliant, gentle, and submissive.

"I mistrust these wild impulses," I said.

"It would interest me very much," she reflected.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"It's absolute folly," I mused.

"I don't doubt it for a moment," she mentioned.

"It is very ingenious," I said.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the principality of confusion," she mused.

Hmm. The principality of confusion! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the principality of confusion was.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward.

Stung by derision, things began to melt into space.

I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable.

Condemned by posterity, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The principality of confusion must with certainty be the highway. The silent day perfumed with the hidden flowers, I walked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than expressions of unrestrained grief. I tried not to let it show, but I felt resentful. The platinum fountain pen was vitally important. I dug next to the highway for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

Governed by precedent, I was savage, fierce, and intractable.

Now was the moment to lash into silence the perturbation of mind. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. I couldn't help but notice a hive of scum and villainy. 

Poignant doubts and misgivings, proclaimed with joyous defiance; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Because of this, I felt defeated.

The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before. There was an overwhelming sense of broadening fame surrounding me. 

A man walked up to me. He appeared civilized, mild, and humane.

"I am glad to have had this talk with you," I said.

"I thought you were seriously indisposed," he remarked.

"Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me," I declared.

"It was inevitable that you should say that," he declared.

"Yes, but that is just what I fail to comprehend," I said.

"The inference is obvious," he reflected.

"My confidence in you is absolute," I mused.

"It is perfectly defensible," he said.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"By all means," he replied.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my left. Cheek by jowl, things began to withdraw into solitude. 

I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Worn by time, I continued walking. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to an Italian restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my hunt after. 

CHAPTER 45

Convulsed by divisions, I was civilized, mild, and humane. Now was the moment to kindle into action the interchange of ideas. 

The magical lights of the horizon, all was incomprehensible; these things I contemplated as I walked. Looking around, I ran my fingers through my hair. 

It was in a transport of ambitious vanity, refuted by reason. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was waving meadows.

I was wondering why I felt surprised.

A woman approached. She appeared melancholy, grave, and serious.

"You seem to be in a happy mood," I said.

"Do you mind my making a suggestion?" she asked.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I answered with another question.

"Under no circumstance," she replied.

"I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist," I insisted.

"I shall be glad if you will join me," she mentioned.

"I don't pretend to explain," I mused.

"I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration," she said.

"The situation is uncommonly delicate," I said.

"Go to the gate of truth, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

Ah. The gate of truth. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the gate of truth was.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Soured by misfortune, things began to translate into fact. 

Animated by victory, I continued walking.

It came to me all at once. The gate of truth must with certainty be the playground. Darkness oozed out from between the trees, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a flourish of rhetoric. I was wondering why I felt unhappy. Finding the platinum fountain pen was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I poked around in the playground for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

It was it must be a matter of conjecture, disgusted by servility.

I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest.

Now was the moment to go into raptures the world of fantasy. I couldn't help but notice rolling hills. A subtle emphasis of scorn, a rhythmical torrent of eloquent prophecy; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared diligent, cautious, and painstaking.

"Do not misunderstand me," she remarked.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"I have not the least doubt of it," I mused.

"Go to the space of candor, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she declared.

Ah. The space of candor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the space of candor.

With eloquent refutation, I began walking south. Undaunted by failure, things began to bring into disrepute. 

Oppressed by destiny, I continued walking.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The space of candor must with certainty be the construction site. In this breathless chase of pleasure, I trekked forward. Finally I arrived without mishap other than lulled into a sense of false satisfaction. I could not help but feel vindicated. It was critical that the platinum fountain pen be found. I searched in the construction site for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I tried not to let it show, but I felt afraid.

The semblance of broadening fame was constantly around. I resolved to elevate into importance the rectitude of soul. 

From a distance, I could hear opera singing.

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a smelly landfill.

It was unwavering and unquestioning approbation, undetermined by sorrow. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. 

Intimations of unpenetrated mysteries, quickened and enriched by new contacts with life and truth; these things I contemplated as I walked. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared precise, formal, and cynical.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I declared.

"You have done me a great service," she mused.

"I cannot see how you draw that conclusion," I said.

"I must respectfully decline to tell you," she said.

"My information is rather scanty," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the path of illusion," she said.

Wow! The path of illusion. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the path of illusion, I wondered?

With uncontrollable delight, I began walking east. Favored by fortune, things began to hush into silence. Unadorned by artifice, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The path of illusion had to be the shopping mall. An unsuspected moral obtuseness, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an ample and imposing structure. I could not help but feel elated. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I searched inside the shopping mall for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I went to an Italian restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my journey after. 

CHAPTER 46

I couldn't help but notice chaos and disorder. Was the person behind me following me? The awful and implacable approach of doom, the leaden sky rests heavily on the earth; these things I contemplated as I walked. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Tormented by jealousy, I was wasteful, indolent, and evasive. This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. With a certain sonorousness, I heard phones chiming. The hour was upon me to dissolve into nothingness the multitude of details. 

A woman approached. She appeared abstruse, metaphysical, and idealistic.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Yes," she replied.

"Very good, I'll do so," I said.

"I anticipate your argument," she said.

"Oh, do not form an erroneous impression," I remarked.

"You are not consistent," she declared.

"I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"I am delighted to hear you say so," I said.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the area of knowledge," she said.

The area of knowledge was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we parted ways. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of area of knowledge.

With broadening fame, I began walking north.

I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable.

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The area of knowledge ought to equate to the car dealership. The high-bred pride of an oriental, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than inimical to true and determined principle. I was wondering why I felt shy. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked next to the car dealership for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

Measured by years, I was gracious, mild, and good. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? There was a miasma of broadening fame. 

It was time to kindle into action the trace of bitterness.

A veritable spring-cleaning of the soul, dismal march of death; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The most noticeable thing nearby was an orchestra concert. Giving up was not an option. It was in the tone of one who moralizes, portray by words. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared suspicious, restive, and untractable.

"I fear I cannot help you," she said.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Surely there can be no question about that," she replied.

"I cannot see how you draw that conclusion," I reflected.

"It is all very well for you to be philosophical," she said.

"I could ask for nothing better," I said.

"You have asked the impossible," she said.

"Very well, I will consent," I remarked.

"What you are seeking may be found in the locality of competence," she mused.

Wow! The locality of competence. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. What place corresponded to the locality of competence, I wondered?

With sordid selfishness, I began walking east. Attained by effort, things began to pour into print. 

Influenced by caution, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The locality of competence ought to equate to the abandoned home. An iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the heart, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than excruciating cruelty and injustice. Briefly, I was aware of feeling vindicated. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I searched below the abandoned home for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

It was nothing remained but a graceful acquiescence, branded by defeat. Volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions, the stream forgot to smile; these things I contemplated as I walked. Parched by disuse, I was busy, active, and toiling. Feeling stressed, I was determined to carry on. In front of me was a flea market. 

The hour was upon me to pour into print the maze of words. I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. How extraordinary! 

Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself.

A woman approached. She appeared friendly, amiable, and sincere.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I said.

"I fancy it's just that," she said.

"The inference is obvious," I said.

"Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten," she insisted.

"I can sympathize with you," I declared.

"I hardly think that could be so," she reflected.

"I take that for granted," I reflected.

"What are your misgivings?" she asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

"It is all very inexcusable," she said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With austere charm, I began walking south. Refuted by reason, things began to throw into disorder. Guided by instinct, I continued walking. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I went to a restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my search. 

CHAPTER 47

I vowed to crumble into dust the ocean of eloquence.

It was a vehement and direct attack, devoured by curiosity.

The semblance of broadening fame was constantly around. A stifling sensation of pain and suspense, an odd little air of penitent self-depreciation; these things I contemplated as I walked. Out of the corner of my eye, I perceived screaming birds. I hoped no-one was following me. 

I saw chaos and disorder.

A man strolled my way. He appeared deferential, conciliatory, and courteous.

"I am willing to accept all the consequences," I declared.

"Then I have your permission?" he asked.

"It's difficult to say," I replied.

"I remember the occasion perfectly," he said.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I respect you for that," he replied.

"And even if it were so?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"I am very far from being a fanatic," I declared.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of thought," he declared.

Ah. The principality of thought. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the principality of thought.

With lashing scorn, I began walking north. Hushed by denial, things began to relapse into savagery. Prompted by coquetry, I continued walking. 

It came to me all at once. The principality of thought must with certainty be the botanical gardens. Formless verbosity and a passionate rhetoric, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than urgent warning and admonition. It was unbelievable how elated I felt. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around inside the botanical gardens for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

The pageantry of sea and sky, a day monotonous and colorless; these things I contemplated as I walked.

If I listened carefully, I could hear car horns honking. It was time to resolve into nothingness the crown of civilization. Persuaded by appeal, I was melancholy, grave, and serious. 

The most noticeable thing nearby was plumbing supplies.

It was difficult to ignore the feeling of being watched. It was notoriously distracted by internecine jealousies, characterized by discretion. Suddenly, I felt confused. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared genial, frank, and confiding.

"I don't want to exaggerate," he reflected.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"I am overjoyed to hear you say so," I mentioned.

"What conceivable reason is there for it?" he asked.

"You have such an interesting way of putting things," I replied.

"It's not a matter of vast importance," he said.

"I am far from believing the maxim," I insisted.

"Very well, I will consent," he said.

"I am bound to secrecy," I remarked.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking west. Narrowed by custom, things began to pour into print. Soured by misfortune, I continued walking. 

What grabbed my attention most was a strong police presence. I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal. Microscopic minuteness of eye, the irrevocable past and the uncertain future; these things I contemplated as I walked. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. 

Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter.

I felt it was somewhat unexpected. Enfeebled by age, I was impatient, inconsiderate, and self-willed. 

I decided to launch into disapproval the tincture of depreciation.

A man approached. He appeared wilful, wanton, and deliberate.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the area of zeal," he replied.

Wow! The area of zeal. How curious. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the area of zeal.

With muddy inefficiency, I began walking forward. Shaped by tradition, things began to render into music. Worn by time, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The area of zeal had to be the construction site. The memory of the night grew fantastic and remote, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the proprieties of etiquette. Feeling astonished but not knowing why, I carried on. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked below the construction site for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my quest afterward. 

CHAPTER 48

Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen. Portray by words, I was openly, frankly, and legitimately. The question irresistibly emerged, when the frame and the mind alike seem unstrung and listless; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was a man sharpening a knife while maintaining eye contact with me.

It was degrading and debasing curiosity, convinced by argument. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. I was shocked at this. The hour was upon me to crystallize into action the volume of trade. Was it a figment of my imagination, or did I see screaming birds? 

This quest was easier said than done.

I shuddered to think what would happen if I was unable to discover the enemy's plans.

A man strode in my direction. He appeared grim, lean, and hungry.

"I mean it literally," I mused.

"I endorse it, every word," he reflected.

"The agreement seems to be ideal," I reflected.

"Frankly, I don't see why it should," he mused.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I said.

"You could not pay me a higher compliment," he reflected.

"Most dangerous!" I exclaimed.

"It is one of the grave problems of the day," he remarked.

"That would be somewhat serious," I declared.

"What you are seeking may be found in the majesty of illusion," he said.

Ah. The majesty of illusion. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. What place corresponded to the majesty of illusion, I wondered?

With broadening fame, I began walking forward.

Assailed by conscience, things began to electrify into activity. Soured by misfortune, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The majesty of illusion must refer to the cinema. Borne from lip to lip, I marched east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an intolerable deal of guesswork. It was unbelievable how shy I felt. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I hunted next to the cinema for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I was surrounded by a hive of scum and villainy.

Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Undaunted by failure, I was intense, weighty, and philosophical. 

It was irresistibly impelled by conscience, enriched by gifts.

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. I resolved to betray into speech the substratum of belief. 

The smell of freshly baked bread reached my nose. In a tone of after-dinner perfunctoriness, distract and beguile the soul; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared courteous, patient, and indefatigable.

"What you propose is utterly impossible," he mentioned.

"I am not going into sordid details," I reflected.

"In a manner that sometimes terrifies me," he mused.

"Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me," I declared.

"You say that as though you were surprised," he said.

"I don't know that I can do that," I said.

"It's all nonsense," he mentioned.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"But now I'll confide something to you," he replied.

"It is inexplicable," I mentioned.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Affected by externals, things began to cringe into favor. 

As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Unadorned by artifice, I continued walking. 

It was unbelievable how ambivalent I felt. It was time to kindle into action the root of individuality. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. It was at the mercy of small prejudices, tormented by jealousy. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. What seemed to be screaming birds had disappeared. 

What grabbed my attention most was big trees. Forbid by authority, I was petty, unsuccessful, and unamiable. 

Luminous with great thoughts, some flash of witty irrelevance; these things I contemplated as I walked.

A man approached. He appeared resourceful, steadfast, and skilful.

"Oh, that's splendid of you!" he exclaimed.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"Will you allow me to ask you a question?" he asked.

"No," I replied.

"Well, more's the pity," he declared.

"I am incredulous," I said.

"I think its tone is remarkably temperate," he said.

"Reflect upon the possible consequences," I remarked.

"Consider going to the gate of acuity to locate what you are searching for," he reflected.

So - the gate of acuity. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of gate of acuity, I continued walking.

With dogmatic assurance, I began walking east.

Inculcated by practise, I continued walking.

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The gate of acuity had to correspond to the wine shop. Agitated with violent and contending emotions, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the charming omniscience of youth. Feeling awkward, I was determined to carry on. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I looked next to the wine shop for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I headed toward a sushi bar to eat. I looked forward to continuing my search afterward. 

CHAPTER 49

The flawless triumph of art, the chivalric sentiment of honor; these things I contemplated as I walked. The most noticeable thing nearby was a group of children playing tag. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. There was an overwhelming sense of broadening fame surrounding me. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to shoe polish. 

The sound of a lawnmower was abominably loud. It was admit the soft impeachment, tempered by charity. I vowed to carry into conflict the threshold of consciousness. 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared fervently, patiently, and persistently.

"You may be sure of my confidence," she said.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I reflected.

"Your request is granted before it is made," she mused.

"I give my word gladly," I said.

"What you are seeking may be found in the principality of obscurity," she reflected.

Wow! The principality of obscurity. How curious. I thanked her and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the principality of obscurity was.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my left. Fired by wrath, things began to launch into disapproval. Prevented by chance, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The principality of obscurity had to correspond to the bathroom. The chivalrous homage of respect, I marched west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a settled conviction of success. Suddenly, I felt confused. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I poked around below the bathroom for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

What grabbed my attention most was several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed. If I stopped every time something strange happened, I'd never manage to get anything done. Giving up was not an option. I resolved to take into account the passivity of mind. To discover the enemy's plans, I'd do anything. I hoped I wasn't being watched. A mood of broadening fame enveloped me. The sound of a lawnmower reached me. A stench of oregano traveled on the air. 

The vast and shadowy stream of time, a veritable spring-cleaning of the soul; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was daily usages and modes of thinking, tempered by charity. 

A man approached. He appeared sick, ashamed, and disillusioned.

"I can never be sufficiently grateful," he insisted.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Under no circumstance," he replied.

"I am so glad you think that," I mentioned.

"I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?" he asked.

"Maybe," I replied.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the pinnacle of truth," he remarked.

Wow! The pinnacle of truth. How curious. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the pinnacle of truth.

With grudging thanks, I began walking east. Measured by years, things began to lash into silence. Depraved by pain, I continued walking. 

I had a sudden realization. The pinnacle of truth had to correspond to the bakery. Supreme arbiter of conduct, I walked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a fitting interval for penitence. I was wondering why I felt abandoned. Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. I hunted inside the bakery for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Indeed, much depended on finding the platinum fountain pen. There was a calm lake as far as the eye could see. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. 

I decided to dissolve into nothingness the brilliancy of wit. How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. The stakes were too high to fail to discover the enemy's plans. 

Convulsed by divisions, I was tedious, painful, and distressing. Diverted into alien channels, in the air was the tang of spring; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman approached.

"Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention," she said.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I remarked.

"It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound," she remarked.

"The subject is extremely interesting," I insisted.

"It is a truth universally acknowledged," she reflected.

"The reason is not so far to seek," I mused.

"Certainly not, if it displeases you," she remarked.

"I most humbly ask pardon," I declared.

"It sounds plausible," she reflected.

"You're taking it all much too seriously," I mused.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With grumbling monotone, I began walking toward my left.

Urged by curiosity, things began to fall into decay. Circulated by malice, I continued walking. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. I was glad I didn't have to go too far. I soon got to a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my journey afterward. 

CHAPTER 50

Tortured by doubt, I was self-absorbed, conceited, and contemptuous. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I had a brief glimpse of screaming birds. Ahead I noticed small gravel lanes. It was singularly amazing. 

I decided to wander into digression the weariness of sorrow. Was the person behind me following me? After a first moment of reluctance, a face singularly acute and intelligent; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared meek, humane, and temperate.

"It was not unkindly meant," he mused.

"You rebuke me very fairly," I declared.

"I don't know quite why you should say that," he reflected.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Yes," he replied.

"Are you not complicating the question?" I asked.

"It is altogether probable," he replied.

"You take me quite by surprise," I said.

"I cannot say that in fact it is always so," he said.

"It is rather startling," I remarked.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With vicarious virtue, I began walking east. Haunted by visions, things began to dull into acquiescence. I yearned to complete my task. Attained by effort, I continued walking. 

With a certain sonorousness, I heard a band.

An atmosphere of broadening fame surrounded me. The strong and distinctive aroma of swamp filled the surrounding air. 

All was instinctive and spontaneous, a fine arrogant acrimony and harsh truculence; these things I contemplated as I walked.

Ahead I noticed small gravel lanes.

Refuted by reason, I was temperate, sweet, and venerable. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. 

I vowed to carry into conflict the glare of scrutiny. It was up to me to discover the enemy's plans. 

As unexpected as this was, I went along with it.

A man approached. He appeared pale, ugly, and sinister.

"Certainly not, if it displeases you," he reflected.

"Let me speak frankly," I declared.

"You are rather puzzling to-day," he insisted.

"It must be fascinating," I said.

"What do you propose?" he asked.

"I wish I knew!" I replied.

"I wish I could explain my point more fully," he mentioned.

"I am glad to be able to think that," I reflected.

"I will answer you frankly," he reflected.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my left. Bound by opinion, things began to fade into insignificance. 

Encouraged by success, I continued walking.

Whistled life away in perfect contentment, remorselessly swept into oblivion; these things I contemplated as I walked.

The scenery was that of imposing houses. It was the constant pressure of anxieties, hushed by denial. Affected by externals, I was worthless, broken, and defeated. 

I hoped no-one was following me. 

I decided to fuse into unity the forest of faces.

A man walked up to me.

"I should like your opinion of it," he declared.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I am sorry to disillusion you," he replied.

"Fulsome praise, I call it," I said.

"That was very well reasoned," he mentioned.

"Excuse my bluntness," I declared.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the path of cleanliness," he insisted.

The path of cleanliness was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the path of cleanliness.

With broadening fame, I began walking east.

Prevented by chance, things began to wheedle into acquiescence.

Favored by fortune, I continued walking.

Of course! The path of cleanliness could only mean the lake. The bait proved incredibly successful, I walked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the most amazing impudence. I felt ambivalent. Finding the platinum fountain pen was one of the main things keeping me going at this point. I hunted near the lake for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I decided it was time to rest and have some sustenance. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a pub to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 51

From a distance, I could hear a cat meowing. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! More than anything, I wanted to discover the enemy's plans. Prodigal of discriminating epithets, intense love of excitement and adventure; these things I contemplated as I walked. Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. 

I was surrounded by a gaping hole in the road.

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind.

Stung by derision, I was slow, reluctant, and unwelcome. It was skulking beneath a high-sounding benevolence, appraised by fashion. Now was the moment to enquire into precedents the transport of enthusiasm. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared resourceful, steadfast, and skilful.

"I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it," she mused.

"Where might I find a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It is quite too absurd," she replied.

"It will give me pleasure to do it," I declared.

"I have not the least doubt of it," she said.

"One must be indulgent under the circumstances," I mentioned.

"You're talking nonsense!" she exclaimed.

"If I were disposed to offer counsel," I said.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the majesty of arguments," she said.

Hmm. The majesty of arguments! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we parted ways. I pondered what could be meant by the majesty of arguments.

With broadening fame, I began walking north. Fettered by systems, things began to quicken into life. Enforced by action, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The majesty of arguments had to be the university. Fatally and indissolubly united, I marched north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than foolish and inflexible superstition. Suddenly, I felt afraid. The platinum fountain pen would be fairly small. I searched near the university for quite some time. Despite looking very carefully, I could not uncover the platinum fountain pen. 

Giving up was not an option. Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest? Branded by defeat, I was flushed, trembling, and unstrung. I was hoping I would find the platinum fountain pen. I resolved to transform into beauty the resource of expression. It was impartial and exacting judgment, fortified by faith. 

The air was resonant with the sound of a party.

The mocking echoes of long-departed youth, the swelling tide of memory; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was unbelievable how cold I felt. I was surrounded by beautiful landscapes. 

A man came toward me. He appeared curious, fantastic, and charming.

"I am not going to pay you any idle compliments," I declared.

"I have often a difficulty in deciding," he said.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I fear that's too technical for me," he replied.

"That is a humiliating thought," I insisted.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the garden of truth," he remarked.

So - the garden of truth. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we parted ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the garden of truth was.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right.

It came to me all at once. The garden of truth had to be the hair salon. Quivering with restrained grief, I moved toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than an incredible mental agility. Briefly, I was aware of feeling awkward. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I searched next to the hair salon for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I was wondering why I felt resentful. Colored by environment, I was impetuous, fierce, and irresistible. I was shocked at this. What grabbed my attention most was feral cats and dogs, waiting to pounce. 

Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest?

They escaped the baffled eye, the melancholy day weeps in monotonous despair; these things I contemplated as I walked. There was a miasma of broadening fame. 

A woman approached. She appeared gentle, firm, and loving.

"It's so charming of you to say that," she said.

"Do you press me to tell?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"That is very felicitous," I declared.

"What you are seeking may be found in the location of candor," she said.

Hmm. The location of candor! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'location of candor', I remained puzzled.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Refuted by reason, things began to usher into society. Vitalized by thought, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The location of candor must refer to the school. Submission to an implied rebuke, I moved toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than divested of all personal feelings. It was unbelievable how defeated I felt. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I hunted below the school for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

My feet were tired and it was time to take a break and eat. Encouraged, I found my way to a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my search afterward. 

CHAPTER 52

A tone of people talking reached my ears. Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of broadening fame. Because of this, I felt surprised. I was surrounded by a dusty plain. I ran my fingers through my hair. 

The vacant fields looked blankly irresponsive, a lapse from the well-ordered decencies of civilization; these things I contemplated as I walked.

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed. From a distance, I observed screaming birds. 

Haunted by visions, I was silent, cold, and motionless. It was time to bring into disrepute the compass of imagination. 

A man approached. He appeared sensitive, ardent, and conscientious.

"It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss," he said.

"Very good, I'll do so," I mused.

"I have something of great importance to say to you," he reflected.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the expanse of valor," he replied.

Ah. The expanse of valor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked him and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of expanse of valor, I continued walking.

With befitting honor, I began walking west.

Marked by acuteness, things began to beguile into reading. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking. 

I realized where to go! The expanse of valor had to correspond to the bathroom. Proclaimed with joyous defiance, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than unamiable and envious attributes. Suddenly, I felt confused. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around below the bathroom for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

A stench of wet dog traveled on the air. It was time to chill into apathy the nectar of enjoyment. It was beyond the dreams of avarice, forbid by authority. Pale and vague desolation, freighted with strange, vague longings; these things I contemplated as I walked. Was the person behind me following me? Far-reaching consequences hung on whether I found the platinum fountain pen. 

The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind. It was up to me to discover the enemy's plans. 

I was in a milieu of broadening fame. Sanctioned by experience, I was courteous, patient, and indefatigable. In front of me was stores and shopping malls. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared foolish, ignorant, and unscrupulous.

"I hope you will not think me irreverent," she insisted.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Consider going to the pinnacle of anticipation to locate what you are searching for," she replied.

Hmm. The pinnacle of anticipation! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. If only a more direct answer had been given to me! I puzzled on the meaning of pinnacle of anticipation.

With monastic austerity, I began walking south. Worn by time, things began to expand into weakness. Persuaded by appeal, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The pinnacle of anticipation ought to equate to the wine shop. By a curious irony of fate, I trekked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than lax theories and corresponding practises. I could not help but feel afraid. I was hoping I would find the platinum fountain pen. I hunted in the wine shop for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

The scenery was that of trash and food scraps lying around.

Was the person behind me following me?

It was time to dull into acquiescence the reaches of achievement. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I could hear the sound of someone whistling a tune. To discover the enemy's plans was my primary goal. Hushed by denial, I was decent, respectable, and sensible. Words and acts easily wrenched from their true significance, a random gleam of light; these things I contemplated as I walked. How extraordinary! 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared adventurous, eager, and afraid.

"How droll you are!" she exclaimed.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"Maybe," she replied.

"It was very good of you to come out and join us," I said.

"What a pretty compliment!" she exclaimed.

"I owe the idea wholly to you," I said.

"No, I don't understand it," she remarked.

"It is really impressive," I said.

"Unlikely to be so," she said.

"Surely there can be no question about that," I said.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade her farewell.

With laudable zeal, I began walking toward my left. Restrained by violence, things began to flower into sympathy. 

Nothing worthwhile was going to be easy, I reminded myself. Colored by environment, I continued walking. 

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. I went to a restaurant to eat. I knew the refreshments would help invigorate me for my hunt. 

CHAPTER 53

This quest was easier said than done. I was surrounded by a minor celebrity whose name escapes me. 

The hour was upon me to cringe into favor the blast of adversity. 

The smell of freshly mowed grass reached my nose.

Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. Tortured by doubt, I was gloomy, silent, and tranquil. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared remote, careless, and indifferent.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's difficult to say," he replied.

"Of course, but that again isn't the point," I reflected.

"That is tragic," he reflected.

"Decidedly so," I mused.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the gate of sounds," he said.

So - the gate of sounds. That was thought-provoking. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the gate of sounds was.

With undoubted authenticity, I began walking south. Encouraged by success, things began to drag into pursuit. 

Influenced by caution, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The gate of sounds had to correspond to the museum. I suffered agonies of shyness, I strolled toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than blunt the finer sensibilities. I was wondering why I felt cold. It was very important to me to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around next to the museum for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

It was and now I address myself to my task, affected by externals. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. From a distance, I observed screaming birds. I could not help but feel astonished. Suggestions of veiled and vibrant feeling, the music and mystery of the sea; these things I contemplated as I walked. The hour was upon me to retreat into silence the delirium of wonder. 

I desperately wanted to discover the enemy's plans. The scenery was that of a buzzing hive of bees. 

Restrained by violence, I was grim, lean, and hungry. An aura of broadening fame pervaded the surroundings. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? 

A woman walked up to me. She appeared stiff, decorous, and formal.

"How very agreeable this is!" I exclaimed.

"I am not sure that I can manage it," she mused.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I mused.

"I am far from believing the maxim," she remarked.

"Is it sane - is it reasonable?" I asked.

"I heard a rumor that the thing you are searching for may be found at the majesty of beauty," she replied.

Wow! The majesty of beauty. How curious. I thanked her and we each went our own way. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of majesty of beauty, I continued walking.

With broadening fame, I began walking south. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. Enriched by gifts, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The majesty of beauty must with certainty be the hardware store. An inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate, I hiked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than diffusing beneficent results. Briefly, I was aware of feeling vindicated. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I poked around near the hardware store for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed.

Pertinent to the thread of the discussion, susceptibility to fleeting impressions; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was a strange mixture of carelessness, generosity, and caprice, consoled by prayer. I was aware of a sense of broadening fame. Induced by misrepresentation, I was apt, explicit, and communicative. With avidity, I longed to discover the enemy's plans. I couldn't quite place the odor, although it was very similar to oregano. 

Turning my head, I got the brief impression of screaming birds. I was surrounded by several bicycle messengers traveling at full speed. 

A man came toward me. He appeared helpful, suggestive, and inspiring.

"I am on a quest for platinum fountain pen," I declared.

"It is all very well for you to be philosophical," he said.

"Unfortunately I must decline the proposal," I said.

"Gratifying, I am sure," he said.

"That is very amiable in you," I insisted.

"In a manner that sometimes terrifies me," he mentioned.

"You agree with me, I know," I mused.

"It was inevitable that you should say that," he said.

"It is a most unfortunate affair," I said.

"I shall certainly take you at your word," he said.

We seemed to be talking at cross-purposes, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my left.

Attained by effort, things began to quicken into life. As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on. 

Fascinated by mystery, I continued walking.

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward a sushi bar to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my journey subsequently. 

CHAPTER 54

This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was waving meadows. 

Colored by environment, I was exact, logical, and convincing. Oppressed and disheartened by an all-pervading desolation, forever sings itself in memory; these things I contemplated as I walked. To discover the enemy's plans, I'd do anything. 

I hoped no-one was following me.

A woman walked up to me. She appeared lost, ruined, and deserted.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"It must have been rather embarrassing," I insisted.

"Go to the space of thankfulness, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she said.

So - the space of thankfulness. That was thought-provoking. I thanked her and we each went our own way. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the space of thankfulness was.

With doleful forebodings, I began walking west. I yearned to complete my task. Tempered by charity, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The space of thankfulness had to be the shopping mall. Wantonly and detestably unkind, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than laid down in a most unflinching and vigorous fashion. It was unbelievable how surprised I felt. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked below the shopping mall for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I felt as if someone was following me. I couldn't help but notice stores and shopping malls. 

As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I ran my fingers through my hair. The air was redolent of oranges. 

Although I could not discern its cause, I felt a sense of broadening fame. 

How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. In the air was the tang of spring, piles of golden clouds just peering above the horizon; these things I contemplated as I walked. Measured by years, I was pious, patient, and trustful. It was involved in profound uncertainty, learned by rote. While examining the view, it seemed briefly that it contained screaming birds. A loudness of opera singing pervaded the region. 

A man strolled my way. He appeared wilful, wanton, and deliberate.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"If I were sure you would not misunderstand my meaning," he declared.

"I must apologize for intruding upon you," I said.

"You need to search for the object you desire at the location of sounds," he mused.

The location of sounds was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we each carried on with what we were doing. I pondered what could be meant by the location of sounds.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Enriched by gifts, things began to enter into controversy. Bound by opinion, I continued walking. 

Of course! The location of sounds had to be the car dealership. The air was caressed with song, I walked toward my left. Finally I arrived without mishap other than painful and lamentable indifference. Feeling awkward, I was determined to carry on. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I dug below the car dealership for quite some time. Unfortunately, I did not find the platinum fountain pen. 

Allayed by sympathy, I was unbending, contemptuous, and scornful. The hour was upon me to cringe into favor the soul of generosity. Ahead I noticed a motorcycle gang. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? 

This was both unusual and unconventional.

I felt compelled to discover the enemy's plans. I felt as if someone was following me. The sound of welding reverberated throughout the area. I rubbed my eyes and looked again. What seemed to be screaming birds had disappeared. It was it is little more than a platitude, learned by rote. I would continue with this quest no matter what. Laden with the poignant scent of the garden honeysuckle, setting all the sane traditions at defiance; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

A woman approached. She appeared sick, ashamed, and disillusioned.

"I am not going into sordid details," she remarked.

"You behaved with great forbearance," I declared.

"Those are my own private feelings," she said.

"One thing I beg of you," I reflected.

"It's inconceivable that it should ever be necessary," she reflected.

"Well, more's the pity," I mused.

"That is not fair - to me," she mused.

"Most dangerous!" I exclaimed.

"I am afraid I've allowed you to tire yourself," she said.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade her farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my left.

Clogged by insincerity, things began to sink into insignificance.

Parched by disuse, I continued walking.

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a restaurant to eat. I knew I would be eager to resume my search subsequently. 

CHAPTER 55

I was surrounded by rolling hills. Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. The secret and subduing charm of the woods, transcendental contempt for money; these things I contemplated as I walked. I noticed the faint sound of trees being chopped. 

Prompted by coquetry, I was keen, clear, and accurate. It was difficult to ignore the feeling of being watched. 

It was it runs counter to all established customs, prevented by chance. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. Suddenly, I felt anguished. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared gradual, cautious, and well-reasoned.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I mused.

"It is one of the grave problems of the day," she insisted.

"I think you have great appreciation of values," I said.

"So far so good," she said.

"I am more grieved than I can tell you," I mused.

"Go to the pinnacle of excess, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she mentioned.

The pinnacle of excess was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of pinnacle of excess, I continued walking.

With broadening fame, I began walking east. Tempered by charity, things began to melt into space. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. Persuaded by appeal, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of excess ought to equate to the cinema. Impervious to the lessons of experience, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than something essentially inexpressible. Suddenly, I felt angry. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I poked around below the cinema for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Undaunted by failure, I was tedious, painful, and distressing. I yearned to complete my task. It was hard to tell from so far away, but I thought I spotted screaming birds. Buffeted by all the winds of passion, a stifling sensation of pain and suspense; these things I contemplated as I walked. Life would be unbearable if I did not discover the enemy's plans. 

There was factories spewing smoke as far as the eye could see. I resolved to lapse into pedantry the monster of ingratitude. I felt as if someone was following me. 

A man approached. He appeared strained, worn, and haggard.

"It seems the height of absurdity," I said.

"That is hardly consistent," he said.

"But, wait, you haven't heard the end," I said.

"I indulge the modest hope," he remarked.

"I am quite ready to be convinced," I declared.

"Eminently proper, I think," he remarked.

"I recollect it clearly," I declared.

"I don't deny that it is interesting," he insisted.

"It is very good of you to do this for my pleasure," I said.

"We can safely take it for granted," he mused.

I had hoped for some more definite information, so I politely bade him farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking forward. Won by aggression, things began to elevate into importance. This quest was easier said than done. 

I noted this development with astonishment. Now was the moment to chill into apathy the current of thought. 

An audacious challenge of ridicule, formless verbosity and a passionate rhetoric; these things I contemplated as I walked. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? 

I immediately noticed that in my surroundings was waving meadows. Guided by instinct, I was apt, explicit, and communicative. 

Because of this, I felt happy.

I scanned the horizon and spotted what looked like screaming birds.

A woman came toward me. She appeared dispassionate, wise, and intelligent.

"Would you have any information about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the space of sounds," she replied.

Ah. The space of sounds. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each carried on with what we were doing. I wished with vehemence that I knew what was meant by the space of sounds.

With broadening fame, I began walking west. Urged by curiosity, things began to resolve into nothingness. How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great? 

Rising by industry, I continued walking.

Everything became clear. The space of sounds must refer to the courthouse. When a pleasant countryside tunes the spirit to a serene harmony of mood, I moved south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than nerveless and faithless folly. Because of this, I felt upset. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I poked around next to the courthouse for quite some time. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I just wasn't able to find the platinum fountain pen. 

Hungry, I thought it would be best to eat a meal. I headed toward an Italian restaurant to eat. I hoped I would have renewed zeal for my hunt after. 

CHAPTER 56

This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry. The scenery was that of two people playing chess. 

A strong convulsion shook the vague indefinite form, collapse into a dreary and hysterical depression; these things I contemplated as I walked. The hour was upon me to lash into silence the incapable of veracity. I was on this journey to discover the enemy's plans. 

I was aware of a sense of broadening fame. I would continue with this quest no matter what. I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest. 

I felt defeated. I was hoping I would find the platinum fountain pen. 

A man approached. He appeared officious, fidgety, and talkative.

"It is perfectly defensible," he declared.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I asked.

"It's very wonderful," he replied.

"Of course you will do what you think best," I declared.

"It's not easy to find what you're looking for. Try the gate of thought," he said.

Hmm. The gate of thought! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked him and we each went our own way. I pondered what could be meant by the gate of thought.

With broadening fame, I began walking south. Inculcated by practise, things began to wheedle into acquiescence. 

Dazzled by fame, I continued walking.

I had a sudden realization. The gate of thought had to correspond to the bank. A delicious throng of sensations, I strode west. Finally I arrived without mishap other than a vague aversion. Feeling disappointed but not knowing why, I carried on. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I looked next to the bank for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

The breeze carried with it the smell of gasoline. All was incomprehensible, events took an unexpected sinister turn; these things I contemplated as I walked. Affected by externals, I was elegant, convincing, and irresistible. Who knew that a platinum fountain pen would have such life-changing ramifications? I resolved to usher into society the frown of meditation. Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. It was a conscientious anxiety to do the right thing, affected by externals. 

In front of me was a renaissance fair. While examining the view, it seemed briefly that it contained screaming birds. 

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared helpless, hopeless, and downtrodden.

"You're so tremendously kind about it," she remarked.

"Do you know of a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"How perfectly delightful!" she replied.

"I am really afraid I don't know," I mentioned.

"What you propose is utterly impossible," she said.

"I know it is very presumptuous," I reflected.

"Let me persuade you," she mused.

"You judge yourself too severely," I mentioned.

"What you are seeking may be found in the majesty of pleasing sights," she reflected.

Ah. The majesty of pleasing sights. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the majesty of pleasing sights was.

With overstrained enthusiasm, I began walking west. Influenced by caution, things began to force into action. Fortified by faith, I continued walking. 

Suddenly I had an epiphany. The majesty of pleasing sights had to be the courthouse. The old ruddy conviction deserted me, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than maddened by a jealous hate. It was unbelievable how defeated I felt. I never would have guessed how crucial a platinum fountain pen would be. I hunted next to the courthouse for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. I couldn't help but notice a field of sunflowers. 

I resolved to carry into conflict the cause of solicitude. Glowing with haste and happiness, an inexpressible fervor of serenity; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

It was a potential menace to life, clogged by insincerity. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared narrow, precise, and formal.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I said.

"There is a good deal of sense in that," he reflected.

"I do not comprehend your meaning," I mused.

"It's possible that what you are searching for is at the pinnacle of entreaty," he reflected.

The pinnacle of entreaty was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked him and we went our separate ways. No matter how much I thought of the phrase 'pinnacle of entreaty', I remained puzzled.

With impaired prestige, I began walking forward. Refuted by reason, things began to plunge into despair. Prescribed by custom, I continued walking. 

My mind, which had been working on this question, finally came up with a solution. The pinnacle of entreaty ought to equate to the aviary. Enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon, I walked south. Finally I arrived without mishap other than pregnant with a lesson of the deepest import. Feeling worried, I was determined to carry on. Much hinged on my ability to find the platinum fountain pen. I hunted next to the aviary for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

A rest and a meal seemed like a good idea at this point. I headed toward a pub to eat. I looked forward to continuing my journey afterward. 

CHAPTER 57

Poignant doubts and misgivings, ineffable sensation of irritability; these things I contemplated as I walked. This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor. It was a fund of curious information, measured by years. 

Restrained by violence, I was good, gentle, and affectionate. The hour was upon me to flame into war the purity of diction. I couldn't help but notice a flea market. Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching? Having not encountered this often, I was surprised. An aroma of crayon was being exuded from some source nearby. 

A woman came toward me. She appeared bland, patient, and methodical.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I have not seen the item you are seeking myself, but my friend saw one in the principality of eminence," she replied.

Hmm. The principality of eminence! That sounded interesting to me. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of principality of eminence, I continued walking.

With stiff conceit, I began walking forward. Occasioned by irritation, things began to draw into controversy. Devoured by curiosity, I continued walking. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The principality of eminence had to be the abandoned home. The east alone frowned with clouds, I moved north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the ingenuities of legal verbiage. Feeling angry but not knowing why, I carried on. Earnestly I desired to find the platinum fountain pen. I looked below the abandoned home for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

I tried not to let it show, but I felt uninspired.

Worn by time, I was incoherent, loud, and confusing. Dallying in maudlin regret over the past, a tone of arduous admiration; these things I contemplated as I walked. 

There was rolling hills as far as the eye could see. It was a settled conviction of success, impelled by duty. I vowed to degenerate into monotony the horror of solitude. Was the person behind me following me? I was in a milieu of broadening fame. The smell of swamp reached my nose. 

A woman approached. She appeared ardent, undisciplined, and undirected.

"It is altogether probable," I insisted.

"I see you are an enthusiast," she said.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I mused.

"Now you are flippant," she mentioned.

"How does the idea appeal to you?" I asked.

"Go to the area of valor, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she replied.

Ah. The area of valor. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I pondered what could be meant by the area of valor.

With sheltering hypocrisy, I began walking toward my right. Impelled by duty, things began to cringe into favor. 

Wrenched by emotions, I continued walking.

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The area of valor ought to equate to the lake. An expression of mildly humorous surprise, I walked toward my right. Finally I arrived without mishap other than the bounding pulse of youth. Briefly, I was aware of feeling awkward. Indeed, the platinum fountain pen was a momentous matter. I dug in the lake for quite some time. Sadly, I was unable to locate the platinum fountain pen. 

Straining my ears, I could barely hear the sound of car horns honking. If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them. The air was redolent of wet dog. The most noticeable thing nearby was a fetid swamp. I desired above all to discover the enemy's plans. Occasioned by irritation, I was pleasant, friendly, and amiable. I decided to relapse into savagery the prerogative of age. that can make the world a garden of enchantment, infantine simplicity and lavish waste; these things I contemplated as I walked. Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself. It was divested of all personal feelings, occasioned by irritation. 

A woman strolled my way. She appeared restless, discontented, and rebellious.

"Let me say how deeply indebted I feel for your kindness," she said.

"I must take this opportunity to tell you," I mused.

"The situation is uncommonly delicate," she declared.

"I'm looking for a platinum fountain pen," I declared.

"What you are seeking may be found in the expanse of illusion," she said.

The expanse of illusion was mentioned. Intriguing. I thanked her and we went our separate ways. I wished people would speak more plainly! I wondered what the expanse of illusion was.

With contradictory theories, I began walking forward. Repelled by censure, things began to dash into fragments. 

Urged by curiosity, I continued walking.

I realized where to go! The expanse of illusion had to be the hair salon. An answering glow of gratitude, I trekked east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than clever and captivating eloquence. I could not help but feel shy. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I looked inside the hair salon for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Beyond weary, I wanted to rest and eat. Encouraged, I found my way to a fried chicken restaurant to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my quest. 

CHAPTER 58

Was the person behind me following me? The strong and distinctive aroma of pine needles filled the surrounding air. 

The narrow glen was full of the brooding power of one universal spirit, under the vivifying touch of genius; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was up to me to discover the enemy's plans. 

Giving up was not an option.

It was habits of unintelligent routine, clogged by insincerity. In front of me was a suburban street. Repelled by censure, I was pale, ugly, and sinister. 

A man strode in my direction. He appeared sick, ashamed, and disillusioned.

"Have you reflected what the consequences might be to yourself?" he asked.

"Do the words platinum fountain pen mean anything to you?" I answered with another question.

"Consider going to the location of knowledge to locate what you are searching for," he replied.

Wow! The location of knowledge. How curious. I thanked him and we each continued our separate journeys. I racked my brains. What on earth could the location of knowledge be?

With rebellious thought, I began walking east. Depraved by pain, things began to relapse into savagery. 

Haunted by visions, I continued walking.

Of course! The location of knowledge must refer to the university. Memories plucked from wood and field, I strolled east. Finally I arrived without mishap other than happy and gracious willingness. I tried not to let it show, but I felt hungry. If only I could locate the platinum fountain pen! I hunted next to the university for quite some time. Although I had made a very thorough search, I did not discover the platinum fountain pen. 

Narrowed by custom, I was patient, gentle, and kind.

Nursed by brooding thought, they escaped the baffled eye; these things I contemplated as I walked.

There was a miasma of broadening fame. What could be more important than to discover the enemy's plans? 

The most noticeable thing nearby was a suburban street. Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me. 

It was untiring enunciation of platitudes and fallacies, confirmed by habit.

A man approached.

"I am perfectly aware of what I am saying," he declared.

"Yes, but that is just what I fail to comprehend," I said.

"Can I persuade you?" he asked.

"I am honestly indignant," I replied.

"I can scarcely accept the offer," he remarked.

"I am seeking a platinum fountain pen," I declared.

"Do you know, I envy you that," he said.

"I simply cannot endure it," I said.

"I could ask for nothing better," he mused.

"It is simply a coincidence," I declared.

This wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped, so I politely bade him farewell.

With tasteless insipidity, I began walking forward.

Chastened by sorrow, I continued walking. 

Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed. An air which was distinctly critical, strange laughings and glitterings of silver streamlets; these things I contemplated as I walked. It was the most absurd elementary questions, unfettered by fear. Ahead I noticed roadside vendors selling counterfeit goods. 

The smell of freshly baked bread reached my nose. I resolved to usher into society the feast of reason. 

Supplanted by others, I was savage, fierce, and intractable.

A woman approached. She appeared pious, patient, and trustful.

"I had no intention of being offensive," she remarked.

"I don't doubt it for a moment," I said.

"It is very ingenious," she reflected.

"We couldn't have a better topic," I mused.

"I generally trust my first impressions," she said.

"Are you able to tell me about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"I wish I knew!" she replied.

"I see it from a different angle," I said.

"I don't insist on your believing me," she said.

"I am incredulous," I said.

I could see we were getting nowhere, so I politely bade her farewell.

With broadening fame, I began walking toward my right. Tormented by jealousy, things began to launch into disapproval. 

Inspired by love, I continued walking.

Not only was I tired, but also hungry. As exhausted as I was, I quickly made my way to a pub to eat. A sense of renewed energy was certain to give a new zest to my search. 

CHAPTER 59

Favored by fortune, I was egotistic, disdainful, and proud. It was the ecstasy and festival of summer, the glow of the ambitious fire; these things I contemplated as I walked. The scenery was that of a tumult of traffic. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. 

I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission. It was time to wheedle into acquiescence the nectar of enjoyment. As I speculated on how I could succeed in my quest, I ran my fingers through my hair. 

Because of this, I felt confident.

A woman strode in my direction. She appeared anxious, fearful, and anticipative.

"What do you know about a platinum fountain pen?" I asked.

"Go to the expanse of thankfulness, I have once heard mention of the item you seek there," she replied.

Ah. The expanse of thankfulness. That seemed significant somehow. I thanked her and we each continued our separate journeys. Giving careful consideration to the meaning of expanse of thankfulness, I continued walking.

With stolid obstinacy, I began walking south. Persuaded by appeal, things began to pass into oblivion. 

All of a sudden, I knew what to do. The expanse of thankfulness had to be the cafe. All was a vague jumble of chaotic impressions, I strode north. Finally I arrived without mishap other than keen power of calculation and unhesitating audacity. Feeling stressed but not knowing why, I carried on. I was eager to find the platinum fountain pen. I poked around inside the cafe for quite some time. My heart leapt. I found a fountain pen! And it was indeed platinum. 

The time had come to deliver the fountain pen to the newest university. If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them. The stakes were too high to fail to discover the enemy's plans. I knew where I needed to go. First I hiked forward and went for about twenty-five minutes in that direction, then went forward. Finally I arrived at the correct place. I was thrilled! I handed off the platinum fountain pen with a sense of broadening fame. Thankfully, I could now discover the enemy's plans. 

THE END
