bells
cars and trucks
birds chirping
trees rustling
people talking
rushing water
phones chiming
opera singing
someone giving a speech
drums
soup being poured
spacecraft being launched
small animals scurrying
cows mooing
car horns honking
books falling
trees being chopped
a lawnmower
a cat meowing
rock being quarried
someone whistling a tune
a band
someone tap-dancing
castanets
a party
the thudding of tennis balls
someone playing the recorder very badly
welding
a train departing
coffee being made
