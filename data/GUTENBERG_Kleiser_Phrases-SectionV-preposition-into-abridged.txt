beguile into reading
betray into speech
bring into disrepute
bullied into silence
burn into memory
burst into view
call into question
carry into conflict
chill into apathy
come into vogue
cringe into favor
crumble into dust
crystallize into action
dash into fragments
deepen into confusion
degenerate into monotony
dissolve into nothingness
drag into pursuit
draw into controversy
dull into acquiescence
electrify into activity
elevate into importance
enquire into precedents
enter into controversy
expand into weakness
fade into insignificance
fall into decay
fashion into festoons
flame into war
flower into sympathy
force into action
fuse into unity
galvanize into life
go into raptures
goad into action
hush into silence
kindle into action
lapse into pedantry
lash into silence
launch into disapproval
lead into captivity
leap into currency
lull into indifference
melt into space
merge into character
pass into oblivion
plunge into despair
pour into print
quicken into life
relapse into savagery
render into music
resolve into nothingness
retreat into silence
rush into print
sink into insignificance
snub into quiescence
strike into silence
take into account
throw into disorder
transform into beauty
translate into fact
usher into society
vanish into mystery
wander into digression
wheedle into acquiescence
withdraw into solitude
