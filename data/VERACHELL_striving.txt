Yet I knew difficulties were to be expected.
I knew that the challenges would seem insurmountable.
Knowing that my task was complicated, I steeled myself.
This would be a worthwhile, although onerous, endeavor.
This quest was easier said than done.
Problems were always going to happen. It was my job to make sure I could overcome them.
The formidable nature of my task was worthwhile as long as I kept the end goal in mind.
How could I not take on this task when the rewards were so great?
I yearned to complete my task.
As difficult as this was, I was determined to carry on.
I resolved to stick with my mission until I had achieved my goal.
Giving up was not an option.
I would continue with this quest no matter what.
Regardless of complications, I endeavored to persist in my search.
