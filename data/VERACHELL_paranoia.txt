I felt as if someone was following me.
It was difficult to ignore the feeling of being watched.
Looking around discreetly, it wasn't clear if I was being followed.
I wondered if I had an adversary who would try to prevent me from completing my mission.
Would an attempt be made to stop me from my quest?
Should I be more careful and discreet about my search in case anyone was watching?
If someone was trailing me, I hadn't detected them.
Was the person behind me following me?
I hoped no-one was following me.
If anyone was tracking me, I did not see them.
I was careful to be vigilant about my surroundings. I didn't want anyone preventing me from completing my quest.
Every now and then, I looked around to see if there was anyone watching me.
I hoped I wasn't being watched.
I could not help but wonder whether I was being trailed.
