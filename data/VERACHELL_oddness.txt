This seemed a little unusual, but I decided not to worry.
As unexpected as this was, I went along with it.
How could this be? However, these oddities were nothing compared to some of the things that had happened.
I felt it was somewhat unexpected.
I was shocked at this.
If I stopped every time something strange happened, I'd never manage to get anything done.
It was one of the stranger things I'd experienced.
This was both unusual and unconventional.
How extraordinary!
Having not encountered this often, I was surprised.
This was rather remarkable.
I noted this development with astonishment.
It was singularly amazing.
This was certainly a memorable occasion.
The situation was unique, and I expected it was one that not many others had encountered before.
I could not see this as anything but incredible.
Although this seemd a trifle surprising, I did not let it dissuade me from my quest.
I have to admit I found this a little unexpected.
