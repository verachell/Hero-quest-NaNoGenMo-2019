A face as pale as wax
A drowsy murmur floats into the air like thistledown
A face tempered like steel
A glance that flitted like a bird
A grim face like a carved mask
A little breeze ran through the corn like a swift serpent
A little weed-clogged ship, gray as a ghost
A long slit of daylight like a pointing finger
A ruby like a drop of blood
A soft and purple mist like a vaporous amethyst
A sound like the throb of a bell
A stooping girl as pale as a pearl
A sweet voice caroling like a gold-caged nightingale
A thin shrill voice like the cry of an expiring mouse
A white bird floats there, like a drifting leaf
An ardent face out-looking like a star
Night black as a foam-swept rock
Butterflies like gems
Cities scattered over the world like ant-hills
Cities that rise and sink like bubbles
Clouds like the petals of a rose
I saw a river of men marching like a tide
In yonder cottage shines a light, far-gleaming like a gem
Meteors that dart like screaming birds
Milk-white pavements, clear and richly pale, like alabaster
My body broken as a turning wheel
My life was white as driven snow
My muscles are as steel
My skin is as sallow as gold
Rays springing from the east like golden arrows
Shivering pine-trees, like phantoms
The city is all in a turmoil; it boils like a pot of lentils
The clustered apples burnt like flame
The evening sky was as green as jade
The feathery meadows like a lilac sea
The floor, newly waxed, gleamed in the candle-light like beaten moonbeams
The fragrant clouds of hair, they flowed round him like a snare
The hills across the valley were purple as thunder-clouds
The hum of the camp sounds like the sea
The hurrying crowds of men gather like clouds
The lake glimmered as still as a mirror
The moon drowsed between the trees like a great yellow moth
The moon on the tower slept soft as snow
The moonbeams rest like a pale spotless shroud
The moonlight lay like snow
The music almost died away, then it burst like a pent-up flood
The nervous little train winding its way like a jointed reptile
The new ferns were spread upon the earth like some lacy coverlet
The poppy burned like a crimson ember
The rainbows flashed like fire
The roofs with their gables like hoods
The roses lie upon the grass like little shreds of crimson silk
The sea spread out like a wrinkled marble floor
The sea, that gleamed still, like a myriad-petaled rose
The sky burned like a heated opal
The solid air around me there heaved like a roaring ocean
The solid mountains gleamed like the unsteady sea
The sound of a thousand tears, like softly pattering wings
The spear-tongued lightning slipped like a snake
The wine flows like blood
The world is in a simmer, like a sea
The yellow apples glowed like fire
Thickly the flakes drive past, each like a childish ghost
Trees that spread their forked boughs like a stag's antlers
Trembling like an aspen-leaf
